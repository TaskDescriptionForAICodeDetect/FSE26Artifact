There is a square grid with N rows and M columns. Each cell contains an integer: 0 or 1. Among the 2^(N+M) possible pairs of a subset A of the rows and a subset B of the columns, find the number of the pairs that satisfy the following condition, modulo 998244353: The sum of the |A||B| numbers contained in the intersection of the rows belonging to A and the columns belonging to B is odd.
