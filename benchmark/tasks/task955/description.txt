There are N cities and K roads and L railways that connect these cities. The i-th road connects the p_i-th city and the q_i-th city bidirectionally, and the i-th railway connects the r_i-th city and the s_i-th city bidirectionally. No two roads connect the same pair of cities, and no two railways connect the same pair of cities. Define city A and B as connected by roads if city B can be reached from city A by traversing some number of roads, and similarly for railways. For each city, determine the number of cities it is connected to by both roads and railways.
