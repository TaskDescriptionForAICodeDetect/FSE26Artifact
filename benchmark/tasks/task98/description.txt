A relative named B has come to visit A. He is 3 years old and loves blocks. He is arranging blocks on a board and enthusiastically states he is making a maze! This maze can be traversed from the start to the goal using blocks of the same color that are connected by their sides. Your task is to write a program that takes information about the blocks and the coordinates of the start and goal, and outputs 'OK' if the arrangement of blocks forms a maze, and 'NG' if it does not. The board is of size w (width) and h (height), with coordinates starting from (1, 1) at the top-left to (w, h) at the bottom-right. Each block is a rectangle of size 2 x 4, with colors represented by integers where 1 is white, 2 is yellow, 3 is green, 4 is blue, and 5 is red. The orientation of the block is represented by 0 for horizontal and 1 for vertical. The position of each block is denoted by its top-left coordinates (x, y). Blocks do not overlap and do not exceed the board limits.
