There are N non-negative integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i. Takahashi can perform two kinds of operations any number of times in any order: (1) Select one integer X and write 2X on the board without erasing X, (2) Select two integers X and Y (possibly the same) and write X XOR Y on the board without erasing X and Y. Count how many different integers not exceeding X can be written on the blackboard, including the integers initially written. Since the answer can be very large, return the count modulo 998244353.
