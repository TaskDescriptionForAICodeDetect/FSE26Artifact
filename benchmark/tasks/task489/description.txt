You are a coach of the International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) club in your university. There are 3N students in the ICPC club and you want to make N teams for the next ICPC. All teams in ICPC consist of 3 members. Every student belongs to exactly one team. When you form the teams, you should consider several relationships among the students. Some students have an extremely good relationship with other students. If they belong to the same team, their performance will improve surprisingly. The contrary situation also occurs for a student pair with a bad relationship. In short, students with a good relationship must be in the same team, and students with a bad relationship must be in different teams. Your task is to write a program that calculates the number of possible team assignments. Two assignments are considered different if and only if there exists a pair of students such that in one assignment they are in the same team and in the other they are not.
