The server in company A has a structure where N devices numbered 1, 2, ..., N are connected with N - 1 cables. The i-th cable connects Device U_i and Device V_i. Each device v (1 <= v <= N) has a non-zero integer A_v, which represents its power consumption or supply: If A_v < 0, Device v is a computer that consumes an electric power of -A_v. If A_v > 0, Device v is a battery that supplies an electric power of A_v. You need to disconnect some number of cables to disable the server. The server will be disabled if all connected components satisfy one of the following conditions: 1. There is no computer in the connected component (A_v is positive for every device v in that component). 2. There is not enough supply of electric power in the connected component (sum of A_v over all devices v in that component is negative). Determine the minimum number of cables that need to be disconnected to disable the server.
