You are playing a variant of a game called 'Daruma Otoshi (Dharma Block Striking)'. In this game, you need to remove weighted blocks stacked on top of each other, excluding the top Dharma block. You can strike any two adjacent blocks that differ in weight by at most 1 with a hammer. The goal is to determine the maximum number of blocks that can be removed by repeatedly striking pairs of blocks in an optimal order.
