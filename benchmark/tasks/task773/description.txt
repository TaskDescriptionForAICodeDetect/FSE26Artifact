You are given a grid of squares with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns, where each square is painted white or black. A square, A_{ij}, is black if it is represented by '#' and white if it is represented by '.'. You need to repeatedly perform the operation where every white square that shares a side with a black square becomes black, until all squares are black. Your task is to find the number of operations that will be performed. The initial grid has at least one black square.
