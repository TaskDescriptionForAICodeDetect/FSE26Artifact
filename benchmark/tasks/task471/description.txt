Ikuta has an unusual attachment to undirected graphs. He prefers the pair (G, s, t) when its 'beauty' is high. The 'beauty' of the pair (G, s, t) is defined as the number of edges e = {u, v} (where u and v are two different vertices in G) for which the shortest path length from s to t in G is exactly 1 greater than the shortest path length from s to t in the undirected graph obtained by adding the edge e. Your task is to write a program to calculate the 'beauty' for a given pair (G, s, t).
