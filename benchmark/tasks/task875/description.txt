ButCoder Inc. is a startup company whose main business is the development and operation of the programming competition site 'ButCoder'. There are N members of the company including the president, and each member except the president has exactly one direct boss. Each member has a unique ID number from 1 to N, and the member with the ID i is called Member i. The president is Member 1, and the direct boss of Member i (2 ≤ i ≤ N) is Member b_i (1 ≤ b_i < i). All the members in ButCoder have gathered in the great hall in the main office to take a group photo. The hall is very large, and all N people can stand in one line. However, they have been unable to decide the order in which they stand. For some reason, all of them except the president want to avoid standing next to their direct bosses. Your task is to find how many ways they can stand in a line that satisfy their desires. The result should be given modulo 10^9 + 7.
