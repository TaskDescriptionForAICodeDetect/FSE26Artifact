There is a grid of square cells with H horizontal rows and W vertical columns. In each cell (i, j), a_{ij} coins are placed. You can perform the following operation: choose a cell that was not chosen before and contains one or more coins, then move one of those coins to a vertically or horizontally adjacent cell. The goal is to maximize the number of cells containing an even number of coins.
