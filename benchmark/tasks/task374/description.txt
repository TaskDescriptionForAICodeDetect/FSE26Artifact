A rabbit is traveling in a country with n cities numbered from 1 to n. The rabbit starts in city 1. Each city i is represented as a point (xi, yi) on a coordinate plane. The rabbit must adhere to the following travel conditions: the path must be a piecewise linear route connecting different pairs of cities, the total travel length must be less than or equal to r, overlapping path segments count based on the number of times they are crossed, and the angle change while turning cannot exceed Î¸. Each time the rabbit moves to a new city, it receives one carrot. The same city can be visited multiple times, collecting a carrot each time. The task is to determine the maximum number of carrots the rabbit can collect during its journey.
