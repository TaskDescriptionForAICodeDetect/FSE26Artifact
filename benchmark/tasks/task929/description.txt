There are N buildings along a line. The i-th building from the left has a height of a_i meters, and it is colored in color i. The mayor, Chokudai, wants to be able to see at least K buildings from the left. You can increase the height of the buildings at a cost of 1 yen for each meter increased, but you cannot decrease their heights. Calculate the minimum cost required to satisfy Chokudai's objective. A building is visible from the left if there are no previously positioned buildings to its left that have a height greater than or equal to it.
