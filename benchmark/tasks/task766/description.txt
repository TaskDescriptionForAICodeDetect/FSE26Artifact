We will host a rock-paper-scissors tournament with N people. The participants are called Person 1, Person 2, ..., Person N. For any two participants, the result of the match between them is determined in advance by integers A_{i,j}. If A_{i,j} = 0, Person j defeats Person i; if A_{i,j} = 1, Person i defeats Person j. The tournament proceeds by arranging the participants in a row and randomly choosing two consecutive persons to play a match, with the loser being removed. This process is repeated until there's one person left, declared the champion. Your task is to find the number of persons who have the possibility of becoming the champion.
