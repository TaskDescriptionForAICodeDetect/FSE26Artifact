In a coding competition, there are N+1 participants, including Takahashi. Each participant's local time has a defined time gap with Takahashi's local time. The time gap between two cities is determined by the minimum of local times when one of them is set to 0. You need to find the maximum possible minimum time gap among all pairs of participants. Given N and the time gaps for each participant, compute the maximum possible value of this minimum time gap.
