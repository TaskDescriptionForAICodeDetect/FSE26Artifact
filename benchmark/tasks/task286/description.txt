You are tasked with detecting when a system of processes becomes deadlock-unavoidable based on a resource allocation log. A deadlock occurs when two or more processes are waiting on each other indefinitely. You will be given a description of processes, their resource requirements, and a time log indicating when resources are allocated to each process. Your job is to determine the time at which the system enters a state where deadlock cannot be avoided.
