In a competition with 10^9 contestants, numbered 1 to 10^9, there will be two contests using N problems (numbered 1 to N). Each problem i can be solved by contestants from L_i to R_i (inclusive). Each problem must be assigned to exactly one of the contests, with at least one problem in each contest. The joyfulness of a contest is defined as the number of contestants solving all the problems in that contest. Your task is to find the maximum possible total joyfulness of the two contests.
