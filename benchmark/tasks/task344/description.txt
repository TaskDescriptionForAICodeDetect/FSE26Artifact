You are a programmer working on a new type of storage medium. The medium allows for random access when reading and deleting data but only allows writing data sequentially, starting from the beginning, and the first available free space found can be written to. You are tasked with implementing a file system for this storage medium, which allows three commands: writing data, deleting data, and referencing sectors. Your program should emulate this file system and output which file identifier is in the referenced sector when the reference command is executed. Initially, no data is written to the storage medium.
