Solve a puzzle based on the following rules: Given an n x n grid of numbers, some of which are marked as starting points (negative numbers), your task is to determine if the puzzle can be solved according to these rules: Draw a line from each starting point (vertically or horizontally only) that sums to the same value as the starting point number, without branching or crossing existing lines, and without passing through more than one starting point. The input consists of multiple datasets, with n indicating the grid size and the subsequent n x n numbers representing the grid. The output should be 'YES' if the puzzle can be solved, or 'NO' if it cannot.
