You are to implement a program that handles the simulation of ink drops on a 10x10 grid of paper. Each drop can be of three sizes: Small (1), Medium (2), and Large (3), which affect the surrounding cells differently. The grid starts with a density of 0 for each cell. You need to read a series of ink drops specified by their coordinates and size, update the grid accordingly, and then report how many cells remain at a density of 0 and the highest density value on the grid after all drops have been applied.
