There is an evil creature in a square on an N-by-M grid (2 ≤ N, M ≤ 100), and you want to kill it using a laser generator located in a different square. Since the location and direction of the laser generator are fixed, you may need to use several mirrors to reflect laser beams. There are some obstacles on the grid, and you have a limited number of mirrors. Please determine whether it is possible to kill the creature, and if possible, find the minimum number of mirrors needed. There are two types of single-sided mirrors; type P mirrors can be placed at angles of 45 or 225 degrees from the east-west direction, and type Q mirrors can be placed at angles of 135 or 315 degrees. You have A type P mirrors and A type Q mirrors (0 ≤ A ≤ 10). You cannot put mirrors onto the squares with the creature or the laser generator, but the laser beam can pass through those squares. The evil creature is killed if the laser reaches the square it is in.
