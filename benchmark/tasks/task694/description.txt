There are N robots numbered from 1 to N placed on a number line. Robot i is located at coordinate X_i. When activated, it will travel a distance of D_i in the positive direction and then be removed from the number line. All robots move at the same speed, and their sizes are negligible. Takahashi, a mischievous boy, can activate a robot any number of times (including zero) as long as there is a robot still on the number line. When a robot is moving, if it contacts another robot that is still within the range [X_i, X_i + D_i) on the number line, that robot also gets activated and starts moving. This process can continue recursively. You need to compute the total number of possible sets of robots that remain on the number line after Takahashi performs the activation operations multiple times. The result should be given modulo 998244353, as the count can be very large.
