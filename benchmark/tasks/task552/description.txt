You have N vertical lines of a type of lottery known as 'Amidakuji'. A lottery is defined as good if starting from any vertical line results in ending at the same vertical line. You can choose one or more lotteries and connect them in any vertical order. If it's possible to create a good Amidakuji, output 'yes', otherwise output 'no'. Each Amidakuji has a number of horizontal lines and for each horizontal line, it is indicated whether it extends to the left (0) or to the right (1).
