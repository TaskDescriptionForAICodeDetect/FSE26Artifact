Problem K: Traveling Salesman Problem
Given a directed graph with N vertices numbered from 1 to N and M edges with specified distances, find the shortest path that starts from vertex 1, visits vertices 2, 3, ..., N in that order, and returns to vertex 1. The traversal of the vertices must include the subsequence 2, 3, ..., N. This means that moving from vertex 1 to 2 can be direct or via other vertices, and this applies recursively to subsequent vertices. It is permissible to traverse the same vertex or edge multiple times. Output the length of the shortest qualifying path, where the length is the sum of the distances of all included edges. If no such path exists, output -1.
