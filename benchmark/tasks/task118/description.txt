On a clear night, when looking up at the sky, you see countless stars of varying brightness. You have decided to create your own constellation based on the criterion that the brightness difference between any two stars in the group must be less than or equal to a constant d. Your task is to determine the area of the largest possible constellation given N stars with their positions and brightness levels. The position of each star is given as coordinates with the window frame's bottom left corner as the origin. If a constellation consists of only one star or if the stars are aligned parallel to the axes, its area will be 0. You need to write a program that outputs the area of the largest constellation.
