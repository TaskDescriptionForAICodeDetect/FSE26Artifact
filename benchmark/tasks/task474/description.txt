Ikuota, a grade school student, received a paper with a mathematical expression from his grandfather. His grandfather seems to give Ikuota an allowance based on the answer to the expression. Since Ikuota has only learned addition, subtraction, and multiplication, the expression only contains these operations. Normally, multiplication has higher precedence than addition and subtraction in calculations, but Ikuota is unsure about operator precedence and decides to figure out a convenient precedence that maximizes the calculation result. Given a mathematical expression containing the operators +, -, *, and parentheses, change the precedence of the three operators in any way to find the maximum calculation result of the expression. Note that the operators are always left associative and different operators can have the same precedence. You cannot change the precedence during the calculation of a single expression.
