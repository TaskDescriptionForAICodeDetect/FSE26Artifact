Implement a program that performs Depth First Search (DFS) on a directed graph represented as an adjacency list. The program should read the number of vertices and their adjacency lists, calculate and report the discovery and finishing times for each vertex in ascending order of their IDs. The discovery timestamp should start at 1, and if there are multiple vertices to visit, the vertex with the smallest ID should be chosen.
