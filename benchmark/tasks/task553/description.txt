Given N pairs of non-negative integers (a_i, b_i) and non-negative integers A and B, perform as many operations as possible by removing pairs or groups of elements that satisfy specific conditions. The conditions for removal are: either |a_i - b_i| must be less than or equal to A or B must be less than or equal to |a_i - b_i| and |a_i - b_i| must also be less than or equal to 2A. Alternatively, for two different elements i and j, remove them if the absolute difference between their sums satisfies similar conditions. The goal is to determine the maximum number of operations that can be performed.
