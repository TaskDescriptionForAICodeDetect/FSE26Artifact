You have a new vocal synthesis tool called VOCAL ANDROID, where you can input melodies and lyrics to generate songs. After creating a melody, you need to combine predefined phrases into it, ensuring that the phrases fit perfectly in terms of length. Each phrase has a specific length range and a score representing how good it is. Your task is to combine phrases to maximize the total score for each melody while respecting the length constraints. If a melody cannot be filled perfectly with any available phrases, return -1.
