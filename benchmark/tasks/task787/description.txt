There are N islands and M bridges. The i-th bridge connects the A_i-th and B_i-th islands bidirectionally. As bridges collapse in the order from the first to the M-th bridge, compute the number of pairs of islands (a, b) such that travel between them is not possible anymore. For every bridge that collapses, find the inconvenience, which is the number of pairs that can no longer be traversed after that bridge has collapsed.
