You are given a connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. Each vertex has two associated integers A_i and B_i. You need to choose an initial amount of money W in such a way that you can potentially win a game. The goal is to be able to donate to each vertex exactly once while performing certain operations such as moving to connected vertices or donating money. Your objective is to find the smallest initial amount of money W that enables you to win the game.
