Shinobu-kun and Shizuo-kun are playing a territory game on a rectangular island divided into grid cells, each represented by an integer score. The game starts with a piece at the northwest corner of the island, which moves to the southeast corner. The players take turns moving the piece either south or east. After reaching the southeast corner, the boundary formed by the piece divides the island into two territories: the first player's territory (northeast) and the second player's territory (southwest). The goal is to maximize the absolute difference in scores between the two players based on the territories. Write a program to compute this absolute score difference given the island size and the scores for each grid cell.
