Given a graph represented as ASCII art (AA), print the length of the shortest paths from vertex s to vertex t. Each vertex is represented by an uppercase alphabet and is surrounded by symbols 'o' in its 8 neighboring positions. Horizontal edges are represented by '-' and vertical edges by '|', with each edge having a length of 1. There are constraints on how the graph is structured, including the configuration of vertices and edges. Input consists of two integers (H and W for height and width), followed by the start and end vertices (s and t), and then the lines of the ASCII art graph. Output should be the length of the shortest path.
