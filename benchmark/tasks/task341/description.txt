You decided to develop a game with your friends. The game's title is 'Battle Town', themed around urban warfare with tanks. For the first step of game development, you decided to create the following prototype. In this prototype, only the player’s tank is present, with no enemy tanks. The player’s tank will act according to the player’s input on the map. Below are the specifications regarding the tank's operations. The components of the map are as follows: The tank can only move on the flat land of the map. The player's input will be provided as a string of characters, with each character corresponding to a specific action for the tank. Your task is to create a program that outputs the final state of the map after processing the given initial map and player’s sequence of operations.
