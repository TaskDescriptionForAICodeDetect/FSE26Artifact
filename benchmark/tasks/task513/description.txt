Compute the best order of energy drinks for an office worker in hell to escape using a spider silk after a series of days. The worker can climb a certain distance during the day and may slide back at night. Other sinners can also climb during the night, and if they catch up to him, the silk will be cut, preventing his escape. Your task is to determine the earliest day the office worker can escape if possible, otherwise return -1.
