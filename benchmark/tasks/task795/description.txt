There are N Snukes lining up in a row. You are given a string S of length N. The i-th Snuke from the front has two red balls if the i-th character in S is 0; one red ball and one blue ball if the i-th character in S is 1; two blue balls if the i-th character in S is 2. Takahashi has a sequence that is initially empty. Find the number of possible sequences he may have after repeating the following procedure 2N times, modulo 998244353: Each Snuke who has one or more balls simultaneously chooses one of his balls and hands it to the Snuke in front of him, or hands it to Takahashi if he is the first Snuke in the row. Takahashi receives the ball and puts it at the end of his sequence.
