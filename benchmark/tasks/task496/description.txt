In 2015, JAG (Jagan Acceleration Group) has invented a new accelerator named Force Point for proton collision experiments on the two-dimensional xy-plane. A proton that touches a Force Point is accelerated to twice its speed and its direction is veered. The veering can occur in positive or negative directions parallel to the x-axis or y-axis depending on the type of Force Point. Each Force Point can only accelerate a proton once before it disappears. Your task is to determine the optimal initial position and direction of a proton in order to maximize its speed after interacting with several Force Points in a generated 2D Force Point Field. You will receive the number of Force Points along with their positions and veering types. You need to compute the maximum speed of the proton and return the logarithm base 2 of that speed.
