You are an experimental chemist with a balance scale and a kit of weights for measuring weights of powder chemicals. You need to measure a list of chemical amounts using the weights you have. You can place weights on the same plate as the chemical or on the opposite plate. If you cannot measure all amounts with the weights at hand, you can purchase one additional weight but want to keep it as light as possible. You need to determine whether all measurements can be done with the current weights, if not, find the lightest additional weight needed to measure all amounts, or determine if adding any single weight is insufficient.
