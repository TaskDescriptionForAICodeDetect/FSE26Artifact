Given a string S consisting of 0s and 1s, find the number of distinct strings that can be formed by applying a specific operation on S between 0 and K times (inclusive). The operation allows removing a character from a valid pair of indices where one is '0' and the other is '1', and inserting it to the immediate left of the '0'. Return the count of resulting strings modulo 998244353.
