Create a program that takes a given identifier and outputs it in the specified naming convention. The identifier provided will already follow one of the naming conventions: Upper CamelCase, Lower CamelCase, or underscore format. The naming conventions are: 'U' for Upper CamelCase (first letter of each word is capitalized), 'L' for Lower CamelCase (first letter of each word is capitalized except the first), and 'D' for underscore format (all letters are lowercase and words are separated by underscores). The input consists of multiple datasets with each dataset formatted as 'identifier type', where the type indicates the naming convention to apply. The input ends when 'X' is encountered and should not produce any output for this input.
