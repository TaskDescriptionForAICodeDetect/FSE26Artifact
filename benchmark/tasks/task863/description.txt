You are given a tree with N vertices, where the vertices are numbered from 0 to N-1. Each edge i connects Vertex x_i and y_i, and has a value a_i. You can perform operations to change the value of each edge by applying the XOR operation with a non-negative integer x along a simple path. Your goal is to make a_e = 0 for all edges e. Find the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.
