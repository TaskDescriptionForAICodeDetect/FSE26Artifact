You are the God of Wind who can control the weather in a 4x4 grid representing a small country. Your goal is to ensure that every area receives sufficient rain, especially on days when markets and festivals occur. You can move a 2x2 cloud that brings rain, and you must not allow any area to go without rain for more than 6 consecutive days during specific periods of time. You are given the schedule for various periods, and must determine if you can satisfy the rain requirements for each schedule.
