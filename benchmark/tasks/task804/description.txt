There are N slimes lining up in a row. Initially, the i-th slime from the left has a size of a_i. Taro is trying to combine all the slimes into a larger slime. He will perform the following operation repeatedly until there is only one slime: Choose two adjacent slimes, and combine them into a new slime. The new slime has a size of x + y, where x and y are the sizes of the slimes before combining them. A cost of x + y is incurred in this process. The positional relationship of the slimes does not change while combining. Find the minimum possible total cost incurred.
