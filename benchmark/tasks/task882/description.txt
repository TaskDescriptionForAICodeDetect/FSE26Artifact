In the year 2168, AtCoder Inc. is launching a limited express train service called AtCoder Express. You need to find the maximum possible distance that a train can cover during its run. The train runs for a total duration of (t_1 + t_2 + t_3 + ... + t_N) seconds, where it must adhere to specified speed limits (v_1, v_2, ..., v_N) for each segment of time (t_1, t_2, ..., t_N). The train's acceleration must always be within ±1 m/s², and it must stop at the beginning and the end of the run.
