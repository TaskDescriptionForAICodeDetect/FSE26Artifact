Given a string S consisting only of lowercase English letters, find the number of distinct subsequences of S that are palindromic. A subsequence is formed by selecting any number of characters from S (at least one and at most |S|), in the original order, without needing to be contiguous. It is important to note that an empty string is not considered a subsequence. The output should be the count of distinct palindromic subsequences modulo 1,000,000,007.
