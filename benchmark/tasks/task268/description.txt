Find the longest string, called the magic spell, that appears more than once on a donut-shaped pattern of letters. The pattern can be read in any of the eight possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal) and the same letter square can be used in different sequences, but individual sequences must not overlap. If multiple longest strings are found, return the first one in lexicographical order. If no magic spell is found, return 0.
