Given two integers N and X, for each integer k between 0 and X (inclusive), perform an operation repeatedly until k returns to its original value, then compute the sum of all such answers, modulo 998244353. The operation is defined as follows: if k is odd, subtract 1 from it and divide by 2; if k is even, divide by 2 and add 2^(N-1). The output should be the sum of answers for all integers from 0 to X, inclusive.
