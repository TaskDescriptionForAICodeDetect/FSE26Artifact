We are playing a puzzle on an upright board with H rows and W columns, where each cell contains a stone engraved with a digit from 1 to 9. You can erase one cell on the board. When K or more stones in horizontally adjacent cells have the same digit, those stones disappear, and stones above the emptied cells drop down to fill the gaps. This process repeats until no more stones can disappear. The score is calculated as the sum of the numbers in the stones that disappeared, weighted by powers of 2 based on the chain of disappearances. Your task is to determine the optimal cell to erase to maximize the score.
