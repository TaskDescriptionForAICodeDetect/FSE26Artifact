You need to develop software that infers the original message relayed to the King by a sequence of messengers who each alter the message in a specific way. Each messenger has a defined method of changing the message: rotating characters, swapping halves, reversing the message, incrementing or decrementing digits. Given the final message received by the King and the order of messengers, you must determine the original message before it was transmitted through the messengers.
