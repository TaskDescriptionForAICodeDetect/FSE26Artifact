Determine if a piece on a rectangular grid will remain on the grid after a series of moves made by two players, Takahashi and Aoki, who each have a string of directional moves. The game consists of N steps where each player can either move the piece according to their respective strings or choose not to move. If a player causes the piece to move outside the grid, the game ends. Takahashi aims to remove the piece from the grid while Aoki wants the piece to remain on the grid. The task is to find out if the piece will stay on the grid when both players play optimally.
