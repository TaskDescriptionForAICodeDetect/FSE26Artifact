The Goldbach Conjecture states that any even number greater than or equal to 6 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers. Your task is to create a program that takes an even number n as input and counts the number of distinct pairs of prime numbers (p, q) such that p + q = n and p <= q. The input will consist of multiple datasets, each containing one even number n (6 <= n <= 1000000), and the end of the input is indicated by a single line containing zero. The output for each dataset should be the number of pairs of primes.
