Takahashi has N balls with positive integers written on them. The integer written on the i-th ball is A_i. He would like to form some number of pairs such that the sum of the integers written on each pair of balls is a power of 2. Note that a ball cannot belong to multiple pairs. Find the maximum possible number of pairs that can be formed. A positive integer is said to be a power of 2 when it can be written as 2^t using some non-negative integer t.
