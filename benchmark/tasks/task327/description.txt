Mr. Bill is shopping at a store. He has some coins (10 yen, 50 yen, 100 yen, 500 yen) in his wallet, but he is trying to spend these coins as much as possible. This means he wants to pay for the items in such a way that the total number of coins he has after receiving change is minimized. Fortunately, the store clerk is very diligent and kind, so change is always given in an optimal way. For example, they won't give back 5 coins of 100 yen instead of 1 coin of 500 yen. Also, it's not allowed to receive the same type of coin back as change that was used for payment. For example, if Mr. Bill pays with a 10 yen coin, he cannot receive another 10 yen coin as change as that would serve no purpose. However, Mr. Bill is not good with calculations, so he cannot figure out how many coins to use by himself. Therefore, he is asking you for help. Your job is to write a program that, based on the number of coins in Mr. Bill's wallet and the payment amount, determines which types and how many of those coins to use. Note that the clerk does not use banknotes to give change.
