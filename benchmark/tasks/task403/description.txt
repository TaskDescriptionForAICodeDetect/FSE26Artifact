The Witch H.N.ELLY is a huge fan of a certain video site. Sayaka Miki speculates that the power of the Witch varies according to the transfer speed from the video site at any given time. Therefore, she wants to investigate the past transfer speeds to the computer held by the Witch. Given queries representing changes in the structure of the internet, calculate the transfer speed from the video site to the Witch's computer immediately after each change. The internet is modeled as a set of transfer devices, with each connection allowing bidirectional data transfer at a maximum speed of 1. The network always operates to maximize data transfer speed from the video site to the Witch.
