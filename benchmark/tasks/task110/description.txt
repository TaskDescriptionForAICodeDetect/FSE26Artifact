Write a program to determine which house allows the scent of my plum tree to reach the most days, given the locations of other trees and wind data. My plum tree's position is considered the origin, and the scents of plum, peach, and cherry blossoms spread in a fan shape determined by direction and strength of the wind. The input consists of multiple datasets with information about potential houses, positions of other trees, and wind records. The output should list the houses with the highest number of days my plum tree's scent is the only one that reaches or 'NA' if no such days exist.
