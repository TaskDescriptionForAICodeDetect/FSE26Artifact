In sliding block puzzles, pieces (blocks) are slid into open spaces within a rectangular frame to achieve a goal placement. Given a new puzzle combining sliding block mechanics with mazes, where obstacles are present and a king piece must be moved to the upper-left corner of the frame, write a program that computes the minimum number of moves required to achieve this from a given starting position of pieces. The king piece is 2x2, while there are multiple 1x1 pawn pieces. A move consists of sliding a piece into an adjacent open square.
