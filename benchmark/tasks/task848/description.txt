There are N squares lining up in a row, initially all white. N-1 painting machines can paint two adjacent squares black. The order in which these machines are operated is represented by a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N-1). The score of a permutation is defined as the number of machines that are operated before all squares are painted black for the first time. The task is to find the sum of the scores over all possible permutations, modulo 10^9+7.
