In this problem, you need to help citizens of the north country play a dice game efficiently. The game is played on a grid of h * w cells, each containing a number. A player places a die on a starting cell and rolls it to move to a destination cell, incurring a penalty based on the number in the current cell and the face value on the bottom of the die after rolling. The die starts with the number 1 on top, 2 on the south face, and 3 on the east face. The goal is to calculate the least penalty incurred to move from the starting cell to the destination cell in the grid. Input continues until h and w are both zero.
