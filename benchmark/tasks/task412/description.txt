In the Neva Kingdom, there are two tribes: the Totata and the Tutete. The Totata tribe wants a road constructed between their towns A and B, while the Tutete tribe wants a road between their towns C and D. The two roads cannot intersect, and the roads must be straight. The goal is to connect the towns in such a way that the total length of the roads is minimized. You need to output the minimum total length of the roads that meet these conditions, or -1 if it is impossible to construct such roads.
