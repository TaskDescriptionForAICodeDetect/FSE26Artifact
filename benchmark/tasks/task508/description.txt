There is a town with a size of H (north-south direction) and W (east-west direction), consisting of plots of land in the shape of 1x1 squares, each with a house built on it. A typhoon occurs over a specific plot and transforms into a temperate low-pressure system after causing damage; however, it does not cause damage after transformation. The typhoon is a 3x3 square with a designated center as shown in the illustration. The typhoon moves in 8 neighborhood directions, meaning its center can move to any adjacent plot that shares a side or vertex with its current plot. However, the center does not move through the northernmost row (0th row) or the southernmost row (H-1 row) and the westernmost column (0th column) or the easternmost column (W-1 column). The damage state of houses changes as follows: no damage → minor damage → half-destroyed → destroyed → completely gone. Fortunately, no house was completely gone. Given the damage status of the houses, determine the location where the typhoon began (denoted as s_i for the row and s_j for the column) and where it transformed into a temperate low-pressure system (denoted as t_i for the row and t_j for the column). The two locations must satisfy the condition 10000 * t_i + t_j ≤ 10000 * s_i + s_j. The input consists of H and W, followed by the damage statuses D_{ij} of each house. Your output should be the coordinates s_i, s_j, t_i, t_j in one line.
