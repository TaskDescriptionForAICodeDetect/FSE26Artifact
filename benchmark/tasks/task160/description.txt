In a shopping district, there are N stores aligned in a row, each having a stamp of type J, O, or I. Participants collect stamps from exactly three stores, and they receive a coupon if the collected stamps follow the order J, O, I. You are to place a new store with a stamp type in one of the gaps between the existing stores, and calculate the maximum number of ways participants can collect stamps in the J, O, I order after the new store is added. Given the number of stores N and a string S representing the stamp types, write a program to find the maximum number of ways to receive the coupon after the new store is added.
