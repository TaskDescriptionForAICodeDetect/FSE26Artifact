In a park with sprinklers that operate sequentially to water the grass, determine if a frog named Pyonkichi can survive scorching summer days by jumping to stay within the watering range of the sprinklers. Pyonkichi can only jump a fixed distance and must move according to the order of the sprinklers that operate. Given the initial position of Pyonkichi and the coordinates of the sprinklers, write a program that outputs 'OK' if a survival path exists and 'NA' if it does not.
