There is a one-player game played on an H Ã— W board where each cell can contain 0 or 1 ball. You found it difficult to accurately move the balls from one cell to another, so you decided to create a robot that would move the balls according to your commands. The commands for the robot are given as four integers a, b, c, d, which represent moving the ball from cell (a, b) to (c, d). It is guaranteed that a ball exists at (a, b) and that cell (c, d) is empty. The board's state is represented in a notation called 'jfen', formatted as follows: [data of row 1]/[data of row 2]/.../[data of row H]. Each row's data is represented as a string where consecutive integers represent the number of empty cells, and 'b' represents a cell that contains a ball. The total of all integers plus the number of 'b's must equal W. Your task is to create a program that, given the current board state and a command to move one ball, outputs the resulting board state in jfen notation.
