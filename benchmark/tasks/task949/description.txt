Define uninity of a tree recursively and find the minimum k such that a given tree is a tree of uninity k. A tree with one vertex has uninity 0. If you have zero or more trees of uninity k and connect selected vertices from each of those trees to a new vertex, the new tree has uninity k+1. You are given a tree with N vertices, numbered from 1 to N, with N-1 edges connecting them. Your task is to output the minimum k for the given tree.
