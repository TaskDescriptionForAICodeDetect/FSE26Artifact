I started working part-time at a rental DVD shop called 'NEO', and first I had to learn about the shop's pricing system. There are three types of rental DVDs: old movies, new releases, and recent releases, with rental prices of a yen, b yen, and c yen respectively. During checkout, specific set rentals can be applied multiple times based on the following rules. If the number of selected DVDs is equal to or greater than d, and the total cost of the selected DVDs exceeds (number of selected DVDs) * e yen, then they can be rented at (number of selected DVDs) * e yen. If the number of selected DVDs is less than d, and the total cost exceeds d * e yen, they can be rented for d * e yen. Otherwise, the selected DVDs will be rented at the regular price. I realized that the set rentals are applied manually rather than automatically at checkout, which could lead to suboptimal applications requiring complaints. Therefore, I decided to create a program that calculates the optimal rates when applying set rentals.
