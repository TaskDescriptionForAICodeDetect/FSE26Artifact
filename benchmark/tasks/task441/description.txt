Given a convex polygon with N vertices, represented by their coordinates in a counterclockwise manner as (X1, Y1), (X2, Y2), ..., (XN, YN), find the coordinates of a point P such that any straight line passing through P divides the convex polygon into two smaller convex polygons with equal area. If such a point exists, output the coordinates in the format X Y; if no such point exists, output 'NA'.
