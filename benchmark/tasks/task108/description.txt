Create a program that determines whether it is possible to reach the end of a board game called Sugoroku based on the rules of movements specified on the board and the outcomes of a roulette. The game has a start and an end position with various intermediate positions that may have movement instructions like 'move forward 6' or 'move back 5'. The roulette generates numbers between 1 and a maximum value; numbers that exceed the end position or commands that would take you beyond the end simply move you to the end. If you are instructed to move backward and go past the start, you return to the start. You are to evaluate multiple datasets, and for each dataset, you should output 'OK' if reaching the end is possible, and 'NG' if it is not.
