Stylish is a programming language that uses periods for term separation and requires proper nesting of grouping symbols. Your task is to write a program that applies the indentation style of one well-indented Stylish program to another, producing the appropriate indentation levels for each line of the second program. Each Stylish program adheres to specific rules about indentation based on the type and number of grouping symbols present. You will need to analyze the first program to determine the indentation rules and apply those to the second program line by line. If the indentation cannot be uniquely determined, output -1 for that line.
