Takahashi is playing a board game called Sugoroku. There are N + 1 squares numbered from 0 to N. He starts at Square 0 and must stop exactly at Square N to win. A roulette with M numbers (1 to M) determines his movement. If the number x is rolled while at Square s, he moves to Square s+x. If he goes beyond Square N or stops at a Game Over Square, he loses. Given a string S, where S[i] = 1 denotes a Game Over Square, find the sequence that allows Takahashi to win in the fewest turns, with a lexicographically smallest option if multiple exist. If he cannot win, print -1.
