Given a positive integer n, compute the least number of multiplications and divisions required to compute x^n starting with x. The operations should only involve products and quotients that represent x raised to a positive integer's power. The input consists of a sequence of integers, each representing n, terminated by a zero. The output should be the least total number of operations required for each n on separate lines.
