You are the director of a quiz show where N contestants, numbered from 1 to N, participate. There will be M+1 questions, each numbered from 1 to M+1. Each question gives points only to the first contestant who buzzes in with the correct answer. The points for the i-th question is an integer Si. The contestant with the maximum total points after M+1 questions wins. If there are multiple contestants with the maximum score, there is no winner. You need to determine the score for the last question (M+1) such that any contestant can win by answering it correctly, regardless of the scores after the first M questions. Given the possible scoring situation based on previous questions, calculate the minimum possible score SM+1 for the last question to ensure that every contestant has a chance to win.
