Mr. Simpson needs help determining if his students' algebraic expressions are mathematically equivalent to the correct answers he has prepared. The expressions consist of multi-variable polynomials with integer coefficients and are represented with lowercase letters, digits, and operators. Your program should accept a sequence of expressions, with the first being the correct one and the following being students' answers, and produce 'yes' or 'no' indicating equivalence for each student's answer.
