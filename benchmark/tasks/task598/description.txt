Write a program that calculates and prints the coordinates of the center (cx, cy) and the radius r of the incircle of a triangle defined by three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3) on a plane. The input consists of three pairs of integers representing the coordinates of the triangle's vertices, and the output should provide the center and radius of the incircle with a precision error of less than 0.000001.
