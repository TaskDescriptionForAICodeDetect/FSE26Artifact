Ievan Ritola, a researcher of behavioral ecology, wants to observe foxes in a forest represented as a two-dimensional plane with lattice points. She needs to place two sensors at lattice points such that the sensors form a rectangle having non-zero area. The goal is to maximize the ratio N' / (|x1 - x2| * |y1 - y2|), where N' is the total number of foxes observed within the rectangle defined by the sensor positions. The input consists of the number of fox lairs and their respective coordinates and counts of foxes. The output should be the maximized value represented as a simplified fraction.
