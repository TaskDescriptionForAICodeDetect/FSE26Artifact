Takahashi and Aoki will play a game on a tree. The tree has N vertices numbered 1 to N, and the i-th of the N-1 edges connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i. At the beginning of the game, each vertex contains a coin. Starting from Takahashi, he and Aoki will alternately choose a vertex v that contains one or more coins, and remove all the coins from v. Then, they move each coin remaining on the tree to the nearest adjacent vertex of the coin's current vertex. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. Determine the winner when both players play optimally.
