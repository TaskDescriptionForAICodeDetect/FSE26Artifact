Write a program that outputs all Monday-Saturday prime factors of each input Monday-Saturday number. A Monday-Saturday number is defined as a positive integer whose remainder when divided by 7 is either 1 or 6. A Monday-Saturday prime number is a Monday-Saturday number greater than 1 that has no Monday-Saturday divisors other than itself and 1. Each input Monday-Saturday number will be greater than 1 and less than 300,000. The output should list each Monday-Saturday number followed by its unique Monday-Saturday prime factors in ascending order.
