You are to implement a program that calculates the minimum total cost of packing oranges into boxes, given information about the oranges on a conveyor belt, the maximum number of oranges that can be packed into a single box, and the fixed cost associated with using a box. Oranges can only be packed into boxes in consecutive order. The cost of packing oranges into a box depends on the maximum and minimum sizes of oranges in that box, as well as the total number of oranges packed into that box.
