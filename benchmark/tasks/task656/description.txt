AtCoder wants to increase the number of contest types to 26 (from AAC to AZC) and schedule contests over D days to maximize user satisfaction. The satisfaction begins at 0 and increases with the type of contest held, defined by s_{d,i}, but decreases if a particular contest type is not held for a while, with a penalty defined by c_i. Each day exactly one contest is held, and we need to determine the contest type for each of the D days to maximize the final satisfaction score.
