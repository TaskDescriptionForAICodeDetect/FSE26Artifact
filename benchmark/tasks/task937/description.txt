At CoDeer, the deer has N cards with positive integers on them. A subset of the cards is considered good if the sum of the numbers in the subset is K or greater. For each card, it is judged whether it is unnecessary based on the following criteria: If, for any good subset containing the card, the subset without that card is also good, then the card is unnecessary; otherwise, it is not unnecessary. The task is to find the number of unnecessary cards.
