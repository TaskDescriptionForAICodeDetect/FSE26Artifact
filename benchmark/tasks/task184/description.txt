Hero Ponta has arrived at the final dungeon. He must traverse a 4x4 square area where monsters guard their territories. The monsters will attack if they are the closest ones to Ponta when he enters their vicinity. To avoid being attacked, Ponta realizes that he can only pass through paths where at least two monsters are equally close to him. Your task is to create a program that finds the shortest path through the dark wilderness for Ponta to reach the other side without being attacked by monsters. If it's impossible to cross without being attacked, output 'impossible'.
