You have n cards with numbers written on them. Consider making numbers by arranging any subset of these cards in any order. Calculate the sum of all the numbers that can be formed. For example, if there are cards with 1 and 2, the possible numbers are 1, 2, 12, and 21, and their sum is 36. Each distinct arrangement that produces the same number should be counted separately. For example, if you have a card with 1 and another with 11, you can form 111 in two different ways, which should each be added to the total. There are no cards with leading zeroes, and leading zero numbers are not allowed. Output the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
