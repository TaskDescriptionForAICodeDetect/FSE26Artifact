We have a set S of N points in a two-dimensional plane. Each point has distinct x-coordinates and distinct y-coordinates. For a non-empty subset T of S, define f(T) as the number of points contained in the smallest rectangle, whose sides are parallel to the coordinate axes, that contains all the points in T. Our goal is to find the sum of f(T) over all non-empty subsets T of S, and print the result modulo 998244353.
