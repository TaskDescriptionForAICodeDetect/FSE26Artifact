There is an H x W grid, where each square contains a lowercase English letter. The letter in the square at the i-th row and j-th column is equal to the j-th character in the string S_i. You can swap any two different rows or any two different columns any number of times. Your goal is to determine if you can make the grid symmetric, meaning for any 1 ≤ i ≤ H and 1 ≤ j ≤ W, the letter in the square at the i-th row and j-th column should equal the letter in the square at the (H + 1 - i)-th row and (W + 1 - j)-th column.
