Takahashi and Snuke created a game using a number sequence. You need to prepare a sequence of length M consisting of integers between 0 and 2^N-1 (inclusive). Snuke can perform an operation where he sets the d-th least significant bit of each element in the sequence to 0 as many times as he wishes. After that, Takahashi must try to sort the sequence in ascending order by swapping adjacent elements that differ in exactly one bit. Your task is to count how many such sequences allow Takahashi to sort them in ascending order regardless of the operations applied by Snuke. Print the count modulo (10^9 + 7).
