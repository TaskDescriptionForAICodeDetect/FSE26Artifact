The manager of a Japanese sweet shop in Aizuwakamatsu, despite being a skilled artisan, makes dumplings that vary in size based on his mood. His wife came up with the idea to sell these dumplings in bags filled to a specific weight, such that the combined weight of the dumplings in each bag equals exactly 10. This way, even though the sizes differ, they can be sold at a fixed price, providing a surprise to customers. Your task is to write a program that calculates the maximum number of valid bundles of dumplings ('barabara manju') that can be formed when given the weights of dumplings. The program should read multiple datasets, each containing the number of dumplings and their respective weights, and output the maximum number of valid combinations for each dataset until a zero is encountered, indicating the end of input.
