You live in an apartment building with a password-protected entrance door. The password consists of exactly 4 digits ranging from 0 to 9. You are curious whether all residents use the same password P that is given to you by the building manager. To confirm this without directly sharing your password, you and a friend decide to use a hash function to exchange hashed values of your passwords instead. The hash function is defined as follows: it can either be a single letter ('a', 'b', 'c', 'd') representing the digits of the password (1st to 4th digit) or a combination of previous hashes defined by operators '+', '*', and '^', which represent binary logical or, and, and exclusive or operations, respectively. The task is to compute the hash value of your password using the hash function and to determine how many different passwords yield the same hash value. Read multiple datasets, each containing a hash function followed by a password, and output the results accordingly.
