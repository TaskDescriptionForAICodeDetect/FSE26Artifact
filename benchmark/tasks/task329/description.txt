In a region's postal system, each post office is assigned a unique number and mail is forwarded between these offices. When forwarding mail from a source to a destination, the path should be the shortest, and in case of ties, the post office with the lower number is preferred. However, due to a labor shortage, each post office has only one mail carrier who can only operate when present. If a carrier is away when a mail item arrives, it cannot be forwarded. Carriers will prioritize the oldest mail and will return immediately after delivery. You need to simulate the movement of mail between post offices based on the provided forwarding paths and arrival times, reporting when each item is delivered to its destination.
