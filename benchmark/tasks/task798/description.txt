A university student, Takahashi, needs to take N examinations and pass all of them. His readiness for the i-th examination is A_i, and he needs at least B_i readiness to pass that examination. Takahashi wants to determine the minimum number of changes needed in his readiness scores such that he can pass all exams, while keeping the total readiness unchanged. Specifically, he needs to find a sequence C_1, C_2, ..., C_N that satisfies two conditions: the sum of A equals the sum of C, and each C_i should be at least B_i. If it's impossible to create such a sequence, he should return -1.
