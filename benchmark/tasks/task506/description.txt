You are tasked with calculating the probability that all participants in a summer camp wake up on time despite some having a chance of oversleeping. Each participant has their own probability of oversleeping and a list of contacts they can call for a wake-up call. The assumptions are that the oversleeping events of participants are independent, and anyone who receives a wake-up call will wake up. You need to compute the probability for multiple datasets until a line containing a single zero is encountered.
