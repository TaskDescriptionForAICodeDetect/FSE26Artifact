There are two teams, Team UKU and Team Ushi. Initially, Team UKU has N members, and Team Ushi has M members. They decided to play a game called 'U&U'. The objective of 'U&U' is for the two teams to cooperate to minimize a common score. At the start, all members have 2 health points, and the common score is 0. The game proceeds as follows: Team UKU members attack Team Ushi members one by one, reducing their health by 1. If an attacked member's health reaches 0, they leave the team. If at any point Team Ushi has 0 members, the game ends. After all members of Team UKU have attacked, if Team Ushi still has members, the score increases by 1 and the game progresses. Then, Team Ushi members attack Team UKU members one by one under the same rules. This continues until one team runs out of members. Given N and M, find the minimum possible score at the end of the game.
