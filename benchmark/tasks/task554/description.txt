The demon king Megumin is planning to defeat N heroes that are on the surface. She can cast explosion spells M times. The explosion spell annihilates heroes within a radius r from any given coordinate. The heroes are thin, so their size can be ignored. The goal is to use the smallest possible radius of explosion magic needed to eliminate all heroes. Minimize the radius of the explosion spell.
