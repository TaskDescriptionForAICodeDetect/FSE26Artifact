Snuke has an integer sequence A of length N. He will make three cuts in A and divide it into four (non-empty) contiguous subsequences B, C, D, and E. The positions of the cuts can be freely chosen. Let P, Q, R, S be the sums of the elements in B, C, D, E, respectively. Snuke is happier when the absolute difference of the maximum and the minimum among P, Q, R, S is smaller. Find the minimum possible absolute difference of the maximum and the minimum among P, Q, R, S.
