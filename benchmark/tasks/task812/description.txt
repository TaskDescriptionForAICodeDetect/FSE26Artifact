You are given two strings s and t, both of length N. The strings consist of the characters '0' and '1', and the same character does not occur three or more times in a row. You can modify s by inverting any character in s (changing '0' to '1' and vice versa), provided that after the operation, the same character does not occur three or more times consecutively in s. Your goal is to make s equal to t. Find the minimum number of operations required.
