You built an apartment with a water tank that has a certain capacity, L. The tank must not be empty during water usage. A schedule table of water usage is provided, indicating start and end times as well as the used volume per time unit. Your task is to write a program that computes the minimum required speed of the pump needed to keep the tank from going empty during the specified usage times. Multiple datasets are provided, each containing different schedules and their corresponding tank capacity. The program should print the minimum water supply required per unit of time for each dataset.
