Given n cups of different sizes and 3 trays A, B, and C, where the cups are stacked on the trays in a specific order (the smallest cup at the bottom and the largest on top), determine the minimum number of moves required to stack all cups on either tray A or tray C, following specific movement rules: (1) Only one cup can be moved at a time, specifically the largest cup on a tray. (2) A smaller cup cannot be placed on top of a larger cup. (3) A cup can only be moved directly between trays A and B or B and C; direct moves between A and C are not allowed. You need to check if it's possible to gather all cups on either tray A or C within m moves, and if possible, output the minimum number of moves required; if not possible, output -1.
