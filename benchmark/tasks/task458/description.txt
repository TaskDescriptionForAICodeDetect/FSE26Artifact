You are given a directed graph where each edge has a non-negative value that satisfies the flow conservation law. The flow conservation law states that for every node, the sum of values on edges incoming to that node equals the sum of values on edges outgoing from that node. Your task is to find the smallest subset of edges such that the values of the erased edges can be recovered using the remaining edges, based on the flow conservation law. The input consists of multiple test cases where each test case describes a graph with a specified number of nodes and edges. You need to print the smallest size of the subset of edges for each test case.
