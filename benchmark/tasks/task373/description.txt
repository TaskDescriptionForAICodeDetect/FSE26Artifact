Nicholas Y. Alford needs to save his cats from magical fences that were set by an evil witch. Given N magical piles with their coordinates and M magical fences defined by the pairs of piles they connect, calculate the minimum amount of holy water required to destroy all the magical fences. The amount of holy water required is proportional to the total length of the fences, and it costs a unit of holy water to destroy a unit length of magical fence.
