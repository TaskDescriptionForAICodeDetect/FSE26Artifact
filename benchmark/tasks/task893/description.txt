You are given N points (x_i, y_i) located on a two-dimensional plane. You need to find all subsets S of those N points that form convex polygons. For each convex polygon formed by a subset S, define the score of S as 2^(n - |S|), where n is the number of points (including the boundary and vertices) within the convex hull of S. Compute the sum of all scores for valid subsets S and output the result modulo 998244353.
