You are given a simple connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N, and the i-th edge connects Vertex A_i and Vertex B_i. Determine if it is possible to assign one of the two possible directions to each of the edges in the graph so that every vertex has an even number of outgoing edges. If possible, construct such a directed graph.
