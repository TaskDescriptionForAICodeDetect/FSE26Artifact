There are some goats on a grid with H rows and W columns. Alice wants to place fences at certain cells without goats so that no goat can escape outside the grid. Goats can move in four directions: up, down, right, and left, but cannot move into cells where fences are placed. If a goat is located at an outermost cell of the grid, it can move outside. Goats do not move until all fences are placed. Find the minimum number of fences needed to be placed.
