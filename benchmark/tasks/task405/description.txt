Kyubey is busy synthesizing witches for Walpurgis Night. To create the stage witch, he needs to properly combine easily obtainable witches from special Grief Seeds. By extracting the essence of witches from these Grief Seeds and placing them into empty special Grief Seeds, he can house witches within them. There are also synthesis rules in this world, which state that combining certain witches can produce a new witch. It is known that if three special Grief Seeds containing witches are synthesized, they can yield one new witch in one Grief Seed and leave two empty Grief Seeds. However, the same type of witch cannot be placed in multiple Grief Seeds simultaneously. The goal is to determine the minimum number of special Grief Seeds needed for Kyubey to create the stage witch.
