Implement a feature of a popular smartphone game. The game is based on the following specifications: A 5x5 grid displays five types of blocks, each with a score assigned. In addition to the block scores, there is a bonus score that starts at 1. You can choose one block to move up to n times in any direction (up, down, left, right), swapping it with an adjacent block. If three or more blocks of the same type align vertically or horizontally after a move, all aligned blocks disappear. After the disappearing blocks, if a block has no block beneath it, it falls down until it reaches another block or the bottom of the grid. After all blocks have fallen, the bonus score increases by 1. If any blocks align post-fall, they also disappear and fall down. When blocks disappear, your score increases by the product of the block's score and the bonus score for each block removed. Find the maximum score obtainable in one play.
