The task is to write a program to determine whether a security agent can complete a patrol through a cave without dying. The cave is represented as a grid with traps that reduce hit points. The agent has an initial hit point and a maximum hit point, and can use potions to recover health. The patrol route is predefined, and the program must check if the agent's hit points drop to zero or below before reaching the end.
