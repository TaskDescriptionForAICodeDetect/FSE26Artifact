There is a tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. Each vertex has a certain number of stones placed on it. The task is to determine whether it is possible to remove all stones by repeatedly selecting pairs of different leaves and removing one stone from every vertex on the path connecting those leaves. A leaf is defined as a vertex with a degree of 1, and the operation cannot occur if there is a vertex without any stones in the path.
