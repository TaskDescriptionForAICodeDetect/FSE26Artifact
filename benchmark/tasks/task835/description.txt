You are given a string S of length 2N, containing N occurrences of the character 'a' and N occurrences of the character 'b'. You must choose some characters in S, adhering to the rule that for each i from 1 to N, you cannot choose exactly one of the i-th occurrences of 'a' and 'b'; you must choose both or neither. Your goal is to find the lexicographically largest string that can be constructed according to these rules.
