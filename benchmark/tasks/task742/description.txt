We have a sequence of N integers: A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. You can perform up to K operations where you choose two indices i and j (i â‰  j) and add 1 to A_i while subtracting 1 from A_j, which may lead to negative values. The goal is to calculate the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after performing the operations. A positive integer x divides an integer y if there exists an integer z such that y = xz.
