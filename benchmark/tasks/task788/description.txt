There is an infinitely large triangular grid where each point with integer coordinates contains a lamp. Initially, only the lamp at (X, 0) is on, and all other lamps are off. Operations can be performed zero or more times, where you choose two integers x and y and toggle the status of the lamps at (x, y), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y). After performing these operations, N lamps are on at specified coordinates, and the task is to find the integer X.
