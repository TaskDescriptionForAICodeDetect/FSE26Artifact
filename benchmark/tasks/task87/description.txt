Create a program that takes the information of food items as input and outputs a stacking order such that no food item is crushed and the overall center of gravity is as low as possible. Each food item has a name f, a weight w, and a maximum weight it can bear s. The condition for not crushing the items is that for a stack of food items (f1, f2, ..., fn), for every fi, the following must hold true: sfi >= wfi+1 + wfi+2 + ... + wfn. The overall center of gravity G is defined as G = (1 × wf1 + 2 × wf2 + ... + n × wfn) / (wf1 + wf2 + ... + wfn). The input consists of multiple datasets ending with a line containing a single '0'. Each dataset starts with an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10) followed by n lines each containing a food item's name (a string of up to 20 ASCII characters), its weight (1 ≤ wi ≤ 1000), and its bearing capacity (1 ≤ si ≤ 1000). The number of datasets will not exceed 20. For each dataset, output the names of the food items in the order they should be stacked from bottom to top.
