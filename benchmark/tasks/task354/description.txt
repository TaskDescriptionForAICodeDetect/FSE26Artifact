A young boy is playing with eight triangular panels, each painted in a single color. You need to write a program that determines how many distinct octahedra can be formed using these panels, considering that octahedra are identical if they have the same color combination and can be rotated. The input consists of color combinations for the panels, and your program should report the number of different octahedra that can be created for each combination.
