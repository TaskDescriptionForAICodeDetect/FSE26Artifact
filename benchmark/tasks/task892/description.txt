There are 2N balls in the xy-plane with distinct integer coordinates ranging from 1 to N. Snuke has prepared 2N robots, split into N type-A robots placed along the x-axis and N type-B robots placed along the y-axis. When activated, each type of robot collects a ball based on the lowest coordinate in its respective line unless no ball exists, in which case it simply deactivates. The challenge is to determine the number of activation sequences that allow all balls to be collected, under the constraint that only one robot can operate at a time. The output should be the number of valid orders of activation, modulo 1,000,000,007.
