Please write a program that determines the winner of a game played by two players based on their moves, which can be 'defend', 'charge', or 'attack'. Each player starts with an attack power of 0. If a player takes the 'attack' pose while having 0 attack power, it results in a disqualification unless both players have 0 attack power in that round, in which case no winner is declared. If they attack each other and have different attack powers, the player with higher power wins. If they attack with the same power, no winner is declared. The 'charge' pose increases the player's attack power by 1, with a maximum of 5. If a player in 'charge' is attacked, the attacker wins. If a 'defend' pose is taken, and the opponent attacks with power of 5, the attacker wins. If the 'defend' player is attacked with power of 4 or less, or if the opponent takes 'charge' or 'defend', then no winner is declared. The task is to output who the winner is based on the moves of both players.
