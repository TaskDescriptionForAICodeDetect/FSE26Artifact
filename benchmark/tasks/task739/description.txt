We have a grid with N rows and M columns containing integers from 1 to NM. You need to rearrange the numbers in the grid according to specific steps. First, rearrange the numbers in each of the N rows as desired. Second, rearrange the numbers in each of the M columns as desired. Finally, rearrange the numbers in each row again. The goal is to ensure that the number at the position (i, j) is M * (i - 1) + j. Construct one possible way to rearrange the numbers. It is guaranteed that achieving this objective is always possible.
