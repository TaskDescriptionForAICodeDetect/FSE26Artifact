You are given a list of strings. Let's play Shiritori for fun. In Shiritori, the rules are as follows: Initially, you choose a string from the list and remove it. Then, you pick a string from the list whose first character matches the last character of the previously chosen string, and remove the chosen string from the list. This continues alternately until there are no more valid strings to pick from based on the last chosen string. You need to enumerate all possible characters that can be the last character of the final chosen string, in alphabetical order from a to z.
