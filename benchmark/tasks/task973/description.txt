There is a circle with a radius of 1 and N vertices evenly distributed on its circumference. You need to choose 3 distinct vertices to form a triangle. There are a total of N choose 3 ways to select these vertices. Your task is to calculate the area of the K-th smallest triangle among all possible triangles formed. If two or more triangles have the same area, they can be ordered in any way. The output should be the area of the K-th triangle printed as a floating number with a precision of at least 10^-9.
