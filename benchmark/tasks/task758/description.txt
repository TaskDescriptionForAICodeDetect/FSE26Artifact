There are N balls in a two-dimensional plane. The i-th ball is at coordinates (x_i, y_i). We will collect all of these balls by choosing two integers p and q such that p is not equal to 0 or q is not equal to 0 and then repeating the following operation: Choose a ball remaining in the plane and collect it. Let (a, b) be the coordinates of this ball. If we collected a ball at coordinates (a - p, b - q) in the previous operation, the cost of this operation is 0. Otherwise, including when this is the first time doing this operation, the cost of this operation is 1. Find the minimum total cost required to collect all the balls when we optimally choose p and q.
