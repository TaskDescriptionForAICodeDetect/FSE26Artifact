There are N white balls arranged in a row, numbered 1 to N from left to right. You need to simulate the painting of these balls based on a string s of length K, where each character in s dictates whether to paint a contiguous segment of balls red (r) or blue (b). When painting blue, the segment must not contain any white balls (unpainted). After performing all operations, you need to calculate how many different sequences of colors of the balls are possible, returning the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
