Develop a program to enumerate confusing login name pairs based on a defined distance metric. The distance is calculated using four operations: deleting, inserting, replacing a character, and swapping two adjacent characters. Two login names are considered confusing if their distance is less than or equal to a given threshold. For multiple datasets, output all pairs of confusing names sorted alphabetically, along with the total count of such pairs.
