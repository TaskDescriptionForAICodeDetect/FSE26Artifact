Your mission is to write a program to calculate the radii of the Malfatti circles of the given triangles. The Malfatti circles are three circles packed inside a triangle such that each circle is tangent to the other two and to two of the edges of the triangle. You are provided with the coordinates of the triangle vertices, and you need to output the radii of the three circles in a specific order.
