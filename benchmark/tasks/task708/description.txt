Given two sequences a and b of N non-negative integers each, find all pairs (k, x) such that a', generated by a transformation of a using k and x, is equal to b. The transformation is defined as: for each index i, a_i' = a_{(i+k) mod N} XOR x. You need to output each pair (k, x) in ascending order of k, and for pairs with the same k, in ascending order of x.
