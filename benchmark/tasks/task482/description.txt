A university student named Izua is an avid reader and is struggling to manage his growing collection of books. He has decided to create a system to search for specific books from his collection. Each book has three attributes: title (a string representing the title of the book), author (a string representing the book's author), and date (a string in the format YYYY/MM/DD representing the publication date). The search queries are in the format Q_title Q_author Q_date_from Q_date_to. The system needs to return books that match all conditions specified in the query: the title must contain Q_title, the author must contain Q_author, the publication date must be on or after Q_date_from, and on or before Q_date_to. If an asterisk (*) is specified in the query, it serves as a wildcard that matches any string. A book is considered a hit if it satisfies all four conditions. The problem is to write a program to process the given queries and return the titles of any matching books. If no books match a query, nothing should be outputted. Each title should be outputted in the order they were entered, separated by blank lines between queries.
