There are N flowers arranged in a row. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ N), the height and the beauty of the i-th flower from the left is h_i and a_i, respectively. The heights of the remaining flowers must be monotonically increasing from left to right. The objective is to find the maximum possible sum of the beauties of the remaining flowers.
