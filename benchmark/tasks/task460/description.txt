You are given three positive integers, A, B, and C, where some digits have been erased and replaced with a question mark (?). Your task is to assign digits to the question marks so that the equation A + B = C holds true. The first digit of each number must not be zero unless it is a single-digit number. You should calculate the number of possible assignments for several datasets and output the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
