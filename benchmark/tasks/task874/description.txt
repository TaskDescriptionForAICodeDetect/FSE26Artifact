You are given two sequences a and b, both of length 2N. The i-th elements in a and b are a_i and b_i, respectively. Using these sequences, calculate the beauty of pairs of balanced sequences of parentheses of length 2N. The beauty of a pair (s, t) is calculated with the help of sequences a and b. For each index, increment a value X based on whether the characters in s and t match or not. You will be given Q queries where you update elements in sequences a and b, then must find the maximum possible beauty of balanced parentheses. Balanced sequences are defined as an empty string or sequences formed by specific concatenations of balanced strings. You need to output the maximum beauty after each query.
