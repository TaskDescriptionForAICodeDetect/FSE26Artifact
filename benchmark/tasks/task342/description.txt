The program aims to convert rhythm patterns from an old rhythm machine that can play only one sound at a time into a new rhythm pattern for an advanced rhythm machine capable of playing up to eight sounds simultaneously. Given N rhythm patterns for the old product, the task is to combine these patterns into a single rhythm pattern for the new product, ensuring that sounds are played at the same timing. If the resulting pattern exceeds 2048 characters, the program should output 'Too complex.'
