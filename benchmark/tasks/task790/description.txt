Snuke has R red balls and B blue balls. He distributes them into K boxes, ensuring that no box is empty and no two boxes are identical. Compute the maximum possible value of K. Formally, each box i must contain r_i red balls and b_i blue balls, satisfying the following conditions: Each box must contain at least one ball (either red or blue); no two boxes can have the same combination of red and blue balls; the total number of red balls must equal R, and the total number of blue balls must equal B. The goal is to print the maximum possible value of K.
