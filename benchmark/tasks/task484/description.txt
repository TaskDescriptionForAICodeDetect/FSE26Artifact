In a soccer match between country A and country B, you have a table recording the player who had the ball and their position at a given time. The table consists of N rows, where each row contains the frame number, the player's jersey number, the team they belong to, and their coordinates. Your task is to determine the longest pass distance (Euclidean distance) and the time it took for each team. If there are multiple longest passes, return the one that took the shortest time. The input describes player actions captured in frames, and specific constraints accompany the input data. Output the distance and time for the longest pass for each team, or -1 for both if no passes were made.
