Your task is to write a program that reads an expression and evaluates it. The expression consists of numerical values, operators, and parentheses, and ends with '='. The operators include +, -, *, / representing addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, respectively. The precedence of operators is based on usual laws, with multiplication and division being performed before addition and subtraction. When operators have the same precedence, they are applied from left to right. You may assume that there is no division by zero. All calculations are performed as integers, and any decimal points should be truncated. The length of the expression will not exceed 100 characters, and intermediate results will be in the range of -1e9 to 1e9.
