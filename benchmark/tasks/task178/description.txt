Course Planning for Lazy Students involves creating a program that reads a course schedule and a minimum required total credit unit count U. The program outputs the minimum number of courses needed to meet or exceed U, given the prerequisites for each course. The new academic system allows students to choose courses without compulsory subjects, but students must fulfill prerequisite conditions for certain courses. An assumption is made that combinations of courses that satisfy the required unit total always exist.
