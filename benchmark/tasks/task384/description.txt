Kitamasa, a student of mathematics, is good at math but struggles with arithmetic, especially with operator precedence. He sometimes calculates expressions in random orders, believing that the final result will always be the same regardless of the order of operations. Your task is to write a program that determines how many distinct outcomes can arise from his calculations for given mathematical expressions. It is guaranteed that there is at least one calculation order without division by zero for each expression, and all calculation results, as well as the absolute values that appear during calculations, will always be within 10^9.
