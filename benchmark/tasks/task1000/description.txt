Snuke is having a barbeque party and needs to create one serving of Skewer Meal using his stock of N Skewer Meal Packs. Each pack contains one skewer, a certain number of pieces of beef, and green peppers. The goal is to choose two different packs, combine their contents, and determine the number of distinct ways to arrange all ingredients on the two skewers. The distinct arrangements are those where the sets of skewers or the order of food pieces differ. Due to potentially large outcomes, the result should be given modulo 10^9+7.
