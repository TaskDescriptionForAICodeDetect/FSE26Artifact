Given a tree T with N vertices, where each vertex is independently painted black with a probability of 1/2 and white with a probability of 1/2, find the expected holeyness of the smallest subtree S containing all the black-painted vertices. The holeyness is defined as the number of white vertices within S. If no vertices are painted black, S is considered an empty graph. The result should be given modulo 10^9+7 as a fraction y/x, where x is not divisible by 10^9 + 7, and you need to return the integer z satisfying xz â‰¡ y (mod 10^9 + 7).
