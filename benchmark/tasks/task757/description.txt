There are N points in a two-dimensional plane. Each point starts moving at a speed of 1 per second in a direction parallel to the x- or y-axis. The specific direction in which each point moves is given by a character: 'R' for positive x direction, 'L' for negative x direction, 'U' for positive y direction, and 'D' for negative y direction. You can stop all the points at any moment after they start moving. Find the minimum possible value of (x_max - x_min) * (y_max - y_min), where x_max and x_min are the maximum and minimum x-coordinates of the N points, and y_max and y_min are the maximum and minimum y-coordinates of the N points, respectively, and print it.
