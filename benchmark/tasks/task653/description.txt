This is an output-only problem. You shouldn't read anything from the input. In short, your task is to simulate multiplication by using only comparison and addition. The first two values are initially two non-negative integers A and B (which are unknown to you), while the other elements are zeros. Your goal is to get the product A Â· B in a[2] at the end by using operations of two types: applying addition (a[k] = a[i] + a[j]) and comparison (a[k] = a[i] < a[j]). You can use at most Q operations, and the array elements can't exceed V.
