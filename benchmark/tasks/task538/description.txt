Parentheses Number

Problem
Define a correct parentheses sequence as follows:

- The empty string is a correct parentheses sequence.
- If S is a correct parentheses sequence, then (S) is also a correct parentheses sequence.
- If S and T are correct parentheses sequences, then ST is also a correct parentheses sequence.

We will map a sequence of permutations to a correct parentheses sequence based on these rules:

- When the i-th closing parenthesis corresponds to the j-th opening parenthesis, the i-th value in the sequence is j.

Given a permutation P of length n = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n), restore the corresponding parentheses sequence.

If there is no corresponding parentheses sequence, output :(.

Input Format

The first line contains the number of items in the permutation n.
The second line contains the permutation p_1, p_2, ..., p_n separated by spaces.

Constraints

1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ p_i ≤ n
All input must be integers.
P = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_n) is a permutation.

Output Format

Output the parentheses sequence corresponding to the permutation. If such a parentheses sequence does not exist, output :(
