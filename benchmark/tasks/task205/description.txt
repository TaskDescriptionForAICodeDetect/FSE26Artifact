Create a program that counts the number of solutions for a specific type of jigsaw puzzle composed of nine square pieces. Each piece displays one of eight symbols on its edges. A valid configuration requires that adjacent edges be labeled with specific pairs of symbols. The pieces can be rotated but not flipped. The program should handle multiple puzzles and output the number of solutions for each puzzle, ensuring the counts are multiples of four due to rotational variations.
