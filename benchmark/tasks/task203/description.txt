Karnaugh, a poor farmer, needs to reclaim wasteland to create a new field. Due to a royal decree, he can only receive rectangular land. Your task is to find the largest rectangle consisting only of '1's on a 5 x 5 grid map where '1' denotes suitable land for reclamation and '0' denotes sandy land. You need to report the size of the largest rectangle by counting the number of '1's. Multiple largest rectangles might exist with the same size.
