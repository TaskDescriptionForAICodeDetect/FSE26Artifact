In the JAG Kingdom, there are N cities connected by one-way roads. The goal is to transport products from city S to city T using multiple trucks, with the constraint that no two trucks can take the same road. To improve transportation efficiency, JAG Kingdom may reverse the direction of one road. Determine if reversing a single road can increase the number of trucks that can operate simultaneously, and if so, calculate the new maximum number of trucks and how many roads can be reversed to achieve this maximum.
