You are tasked with generating the shortest spell to defeat all enemies in an n x n array, where '1' represents an enemy that possesses fighting capability and '0' represents an enemy that does not. A spell, 'myon', affects all enemies within a rectangular area, turning '1's to '0's and vice versa for those already at '0'. Your job is to find the sequence of spells that will turn all '1's to '0's in the shortest possible manner.
