We have a weighted directed graph with N vertices numbered 0 to N-1. The graph initially has N-1 edges. The i-th edge (0 ≤ i ≤ N-2) is directed from Vertex i to Vertex i+1 and has a weight of 0. Snuke will now add a new edge (i → j) for every pair i, j (0 ≤ i,j ≤ N-1, i ≠ j). The weight of the edge will be -1 if i < j, and 1 otherwise. Ringo is a boy. A negative cycle (a cycle whose total weight is negative) in a graph makes him sad. He will delete some of the edges added by Snuke so that the graph will no longer contain a negative cycle. The cost of deleting the edge (i → j) is A_{i,j}. He cannot delete edges that have been present from the beginning. Find the minimum total cost required to achieve Ringo's objective.
