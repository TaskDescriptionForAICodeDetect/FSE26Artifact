Snuke loves constructing integer sequences. There are N piles of stones, numbered 1 through N. Each pile i contains a_i stones. Snuke constructs an integer sequence s of length Î£a_i using the following process: Among the piles with the largest number of stones remaining, let x be the index of the pile with the smallest index, and append x to the end of s. Then, select a pile with one or more stones remaining, and remove a stone from that pile. Repeat this until no piles have stones left. The goal is to find out how many times each integer from 1 to N occurs in the lexicographically smallest sequence that can be constructed.
