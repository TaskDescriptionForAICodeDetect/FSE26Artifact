Two real estate agents found themselves stranded on a deserted rectangular island due to a shipwreck. Instead of calling for help, they decided to try to claim the land for themselves, marking their territories with black and white stakes, respectively. Your task is to write a program that calculates the area of land surrounded by the black and white stakes. A grid cell is considered surrounded by black stakes if, starting from that cell, any movement in any direction will always encounter a black stake first. The input consists of multiple datasets that describe the state of the land with specific characters indicating black stakes (B), white stakes (W), and empty cells (.). For each dataset, output the area surrounded by black stakes and the area surrounded by white stakes on one line, separated by a space.
