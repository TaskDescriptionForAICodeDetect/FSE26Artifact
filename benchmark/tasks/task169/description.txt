Given two binary trees, compute their 'intersection' and 'union'. The trees are represented by a sequence of characters, where a node is expressed by '()' notation. An operation starts with a character specifying the type of operation: 'i' for intersection and 'u' for union, followed by two tree expressions. The intersection is a tree with nodes numbered both 1 and 2, while the union is a tree with nodes numbered either 1 or 2, or both. Output the tree expression for the result of the operation without any spaces.
