Create a program that determines a fortune based on the area of a triangle formed by the intersection of three line segments. Each line segment is defined by its endpoints with coordinates (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The program should output the fortune according to the area of the triangle formed by the intersection points, according to the specified criteria. If there is no triangle formed, output 'kyo'.
