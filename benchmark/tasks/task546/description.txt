Implement a function to compute the maximum number of black stones that can be captured by the next move of the player with white stones in a 1D-Go game. The game board consists of L grids described by a string S, where 'B' represents a black stone, 'W' represents a white stone, and '.' represents an empty grid. The player cannot create a chain of white stones surrounded by black stones, even if it captures black stones simultaneously. The function should output the maximum number of black stones that can be captured in the next move.
