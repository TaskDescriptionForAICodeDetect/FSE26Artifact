You are given an integer sequence of length N: A_1, A_2, ..., A_N. Let us perform Q operations in order. The i-th operation is described by two integers X_i and Y_i. In this operation, we will choose one of the following two actions and perform it: Swap the values of A_{X_i} and A_{Y_i} or Do nothing. There are 2^Q ways to perform these operations. Find the sum of the inversion numbers of the final sequences for all of these ways to perform operations, modulo 10^9 + 7. The inversion number of a sequence P_1, P_2, ..., P_M is the number of pairs of integers (i, j) such that 1 ≤ i < j ≤ M and P_i > P_j.
