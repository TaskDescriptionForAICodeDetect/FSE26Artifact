Given Q tuples of integers (L_i, A_i, B_i, M_i), for each tuple, determine the remainder when the integer formed by concatenating the terms of an arithmetic progression with L terms (starting from A and with a common difference of B) is divided by M. The terms are represented as s_i = A + B * i for i ranging from 0 to L-1. The concatenated result should not have leading zeros and is treated as a base ten integer.
