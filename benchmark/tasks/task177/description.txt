Develop a GUI application that reads a tagged structure representing a nested panel layout and a list of touch points. For each touch point, the program should determine which panel is selected by the user and how many panels are directly above it. The tagged structure represents panels using a specific syntax, with each panel defined by a tag that includes its coordinates. The inputs specify the number of touch points, the tag structure, and the coordinates of each touch point. The program must output the name of the selected panel and the number of directly above panels or indicate if the touch point is out of the main panel.
