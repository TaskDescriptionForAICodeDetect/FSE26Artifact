The earth is under attack from a deadly virus, confined within a square grid. Each area in the grid can change its infection state based on its adjacent areas. Your mission is to determine the minimum number of time steps required for a vehicle to disinfect all areas. The vehicle can only move to uninfected areas, and its position influences the infection states of adjacent areas. Given the grid specifications, return the minimum moves required to disinfect it completely or -1 if it's not possible.
