Sigma and Sugim are playing a game on a graph with N vertices. The graph has N-1 red edges and N-1 blue edges, each forming a tree. Sigma starts at vertex X and Sugim at vertex Y. They take turns moving their pieces based on the edge colors (Sigma can move along red edges and Sugim along blue edges). The game ends when both pieces occupy the same vertex. Determine if the game will end in a finite number of turns and, if so, calculate the total number of turns.
