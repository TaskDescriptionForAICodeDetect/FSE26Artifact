A subsequence of a string S is a string that can be obtained by deleting zero or more characters from S without changing the order of the remaining characters. You are given a string A consisting of lowercase English letters. Your task is to find the shortest string among the strings consisting of lowercase English letters that are not subsequences of A. If there are multiple such strings, you should find the lexicographically smallest one among them.
