There is a rooted tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. Each vertex, except for the root, has a directed edge coming from its parent. Takahashi has added M new directed edges to this tree. Each edge u -> v extends from vertex u to its descendant v. You are given N-1+M pairs of integers that represent these edges. Your task is to restore the original rooted tree and print the parent of each vertex, with the root indicated by a parent value of 0.
