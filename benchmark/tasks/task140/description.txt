In a game, there is a river where players jump from stone to stone to reach the opposite bank. Stones are represented on a grid with 'n' rows. You start from one bank and can either take normal jumps (to the next row) or skip rows (up to 'm' skips) to reach the opposite bank. Each stone has a slippery degree, and the danger level of jumping from one stone to another is given by the formula: (slipperiness of the current stone + slipperiness of the target stone) * (horizontal distance). Jumps to or from the bank are considered to have a danger level of 0. Your task is to write a program that computes the minimum total danger of jumps to reach the opposite bank given the slippery degrees and positions of the stones.
