Sinking Islands: A scenario in which beautiful islands in the Mist Archipelago face the dire risk of sinking due to tectonic shifts. To prepare for evacuation, representatives from each island form a headquarters to determine how to build bridges between islands, ensuring that all islands remain accessible for refuge as some sink over time. The goal is to minimize the total cost of bridge construction while ensuring connectivity between islands before any become unreachable.
