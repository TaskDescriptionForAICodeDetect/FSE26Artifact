Write a program that, given an integer n (0 to 99), calculates the waiting time in minutes for the n-th group of customers at a popular ramen restaurant with limited seating. There are 17 seats available, and customers arrive in groups with specified arrival times, group sizes, and dining durations. The program should process multiple datasets, up to a maximum of 20 datasets, each containing one integer n, and output the corresponding waiting time for each group.
