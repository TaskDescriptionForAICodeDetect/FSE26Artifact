You are tasked with creating a program that calculates the number of distinct poems that can be formed based on a given connection dictionary of words and a list of seasonal words that must appear exactly once in the poem. A seasonal word can appear at the boundary of word connections and should only appear one time in the generated poem. The output should be the number of distinct poems modulo 1,000,000,007.
