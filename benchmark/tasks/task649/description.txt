You have 3N cards arranged in a row, each with an integer between 1 and N. You need to perform N-1 operations where you rearrange the five leftmost cards in any order and then remove the three leftmost cards. You gain 1 point if the integers on the removed cards are all equal. After N-1 operations, if the remaining three cards are all equal, you gain an additional point. Your goal is to find the maximum number of points you can gain.
