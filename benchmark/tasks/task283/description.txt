You are given a balanced string of parentheses. Each time a specific parenthesis is flipped (i.e., its direction changes), your task is to determine the leftmost position in the string that needs to be flipped to restore the balanced state. You will receive multiple queries, each indicating a parenthesis that has been flipped, and you should return the position of the necessary flip to re-balance the string after each query.
