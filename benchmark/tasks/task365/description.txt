A nobleman has fallen in love with a brave princess and wants to marry her. As a condition, the princess requires him to collect a large number of "immortal jewels", which are rare and fragile gems that can only be found in a specific location on a mountain. These gems exist as circles in a two-dimensional space, each having a magnetic strength. The nobleman has only one chance to collect them using a special metallic rod that attracts the gems if it is within a certain distance from their surface, determined by their magnetic strength. The task is to determine the maximum number of gems that can be attracted by optimally placing the metallic rod based on the given positions and properties of the gems.
