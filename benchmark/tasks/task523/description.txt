Dimensional Travel

Problem

Dimensions exist from 1D to N dimensions. The AOR squid can move between dimensions. Specifically, when the AOR squid is in the i-th dimension, it can freely move to the j-th dimension (where i > j), but cannot move to the k-th dimension (where i < k).

The AOR squid can use M types of magic, numbered from 1 to M. The i-th magic allows movement from dimension a_i to dimension b_i. This can only be used when in a_i dimension.

When going to the i-th dimension, the AOR squid receives a specific "dimension curse" that causes d_i damage. Once affected by the curse of dimension i, it will not receive the curse from dimension j (where i > j) afterward. 

The task is to find the minimum total damage the AOR squid will receive when moving from dimension s to dimension t, considering it has already received the curse damage at dimension s, which should be ignored. It is guaranteed that the AOR squid can reach dimension t.

Constraints

2 ≤ N ≤ 10^5
1 ≤ M ≤ min(10^5, N × (N - 1) / 2)
1 ≤ s, t ≤ N
s ≠ t
1 ≤ d_i ≤ 10^3
When i ≠ j, it holds that (a_i ≠ a_j or b_i ≠ b_j).
All inputs consist of integers.

Input Format

The input is given in the following format.

N M s t
d_1 ... d_N
a_1 b_1
a_2 b_2
...
a_M b_M

Output

Print the minimum total damage the AOR squid receives. Also, output a newline at the end.
