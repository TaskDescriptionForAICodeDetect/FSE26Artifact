We have caught N sardines. The deliciousness and fragrantness of the i-th sardine is A_i and B_i, respectively. We will choose one or more of these sardines and put them into a cooler. However, two sardines on bad terms cannot be chosen at the same time. The i-th and j-th sardines (i â‰  j) are on bad terms if and only if A_i * A_j + B_i * B_j = 0. In how many ways can we choose the set of sardines to put into the cooler? Since the count can be enormous, print it modulo 1000000007.
