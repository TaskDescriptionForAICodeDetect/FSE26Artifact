You are given an integer sequence of length n+1, consisting of the integers 1 to n. Each integer from 1 to n appears at least once in this sequence. For each integer k from 1 to n+1, find the number of different subsequences (not necessarily contiguous) of the given sequence with length k, modulo 10^9+7. If the contents of two subsequences are the same, they should not be counted separately even if they originate from different positions in the original sequence. A subsequence is formed by selecting k elements from the sequence without changing their relative order.
