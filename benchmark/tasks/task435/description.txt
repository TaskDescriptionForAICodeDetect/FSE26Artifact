In the Sports Days 2.0 competition, there are cones arranged with directional arrows connecting them. The competitor starts at a chosen cone and moves along the arrows, collecting integer scores associated with each arrow. The goal is to achieve a score of at least K using the fewest number of arrows. If multiple optimal paths exist, any path can be returned. If it is impossible to reach a score of K, -1 should be returned. The output should indicate the number of arrows used and the sequence of cones traversed, unless more than 100 arrows are needed, in which case only the number of arrows should be returned.
