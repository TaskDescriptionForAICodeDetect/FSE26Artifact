In the Japan Algorithmist GrandPrix (JAG), which is conducted as a knockout tournament, you need to determine if the reported number of wins for each contestant can be true based on the tournament chart. The tournament chart is represented as a string, where matches are defined in a specific format denoting the winners of each match. You are given the chart S and the number of reported wins for each contestant. Your job is to decide if all reported win counts are consistent with the rules of the tournament.
