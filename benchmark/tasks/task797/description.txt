There is a connected undirected graph with N vertices and M edges. Each vertex i has a weight of X_i, and each edge i has a weight of Y_i and connects vertex A_i and B_i. The goal is to remove zero or more edges so that for each edge that remains, the sum of the weights of the vertices in its connected component is greater than or equal to the weight of that edge. Find the minimum number of edges that need to be removed.
