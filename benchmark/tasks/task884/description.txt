Rng has a connected undirected graph with N vertices. Currently, there are M edges in the graph, and the i-th edge connects vertices A_i and B_i. Rng will add new edges to the graph by choosing two vertices u and v (u â‰  v) such that vertex v can be reached by traversing exactly three edges from vertex u, and adding an edge connecting vertices u and v. It is not allowed to add an edge if there is already an edge connecting vertices u and v. Find the maximum possible number of edges that can be added.
