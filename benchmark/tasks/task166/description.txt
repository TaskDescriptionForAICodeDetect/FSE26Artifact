The problem describes the geographical situation of Japan, represented as a long island divided into N sections, each with a height A_i. A section is considered land if its height is greater than the current sea level, which starts at 0 and rises over time. The task is to count the maximum number of islands formed from these land sections before the entire land area is submerged due to the rising sea level. An island is defined as a contiguous sequence of sections that are all land, and with at least one adjacent section that is not land on both ends.
