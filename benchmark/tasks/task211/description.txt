There is a rectangular room covered with square tiles, each colored either red or black. A man stands on a black tile. From a tile, he can move to one of four adjacent tiles, but he cannot move onto red tiles. Write a program to count the number of black tiles he can reach by repeating these moves. The input consists of multiple datasets starting with two positive integers W and H, representing the width and height of the tiles. Each dataset includes H lines of W characters representing tile colors: '.' for black, '#' for red, and '@' for the man's starting position on a black tile. The end of the input is indicated by a line with two zeros. Your program should output the number of tiles reachable from the initial tile (including itself) for each dataset.
