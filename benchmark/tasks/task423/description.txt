You need to create a program that determines whether a given equation is an identity or not. An identity is an equation that holds true for all values of the variables involved. The equations consist of logical operations with constants T and F, and variables a through k. The valid operations include logical negation (NOT), logical conjunction (AND), logical disjunction (OR), and logical implication (IMP). The input consists of multiple datasets with each dataset containing one equation, and you must check each equation and output 'YES' if it is an identity and 'NO' otherwise.
