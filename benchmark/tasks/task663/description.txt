Snuke, a water strider, lives in a rectangular pond that is represented as a grid with H east-west rows and W north-south columns. Some squares contain a lotus leaf and cannot be crossed, indicated by '@', while free squares are represented by '.'. Snuke can move between 1 and K squares in one stroke in any of the four directions: north, east, south, or west. The goal is to find the minimum number of strokes required for Snuke to travel from the square (x1, y1) to (x2, y2). If this is not possible, return -1.
