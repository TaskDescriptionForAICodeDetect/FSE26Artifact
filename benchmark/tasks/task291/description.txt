Alyssa is a college student living in New Tsukuba City, where streets are one-way. A social experiment will reverse the direction of one street section each day. Alyssa orders pizza daily from a pizzeria, and it is delivered along the shortest route. The task is to determine how the reversed street section affects the shortest route from the pizzeria to Alyssa's house over multiple days.
