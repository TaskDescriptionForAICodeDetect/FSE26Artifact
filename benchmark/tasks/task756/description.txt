There are N dots in a two-dimensional plane with their coordinates given. We perform an operation as long as we can, where we select four integers a, b, c, d (a != c, b != d) such that there are dots at exactly three of the positions (a, b), (a, d), (c, b), and (c, d), and we add a dot at the remaining position. Your task is to find the maximum number of times this operation can be performed.
