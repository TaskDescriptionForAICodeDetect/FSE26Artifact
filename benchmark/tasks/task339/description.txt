You are tasked with writing a program that computes the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number M, expressed in base N. The input consists of multiple data sets, each represented by two values: N (a decimal number from 8 to 36, inclusive) and M (a string representation of the number in base N). The input ends when a line of '0 0' is encountered, which should not be processed. The output should provide the count of trailing zeros for each factorial computed.
