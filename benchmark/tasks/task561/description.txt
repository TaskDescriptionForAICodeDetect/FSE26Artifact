Given two strings S and T of the same length, where S consists only of digits (0 to 9) and T consists of digits and the character '?', replace each '?' in T with any digit from 0 to 9 to form a new string T'. The integer value of T' (read as a decimal) must not exceed the value of S. Compute the total sum of all possible values of T' and return the result modulo 10^9 + 7. If no valid T' exists, return 0.
