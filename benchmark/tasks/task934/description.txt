There are N oases on a number line, each located at a coordinate x_i. A camel, with an initial water volume V, wants to visit all oases. The camel can walk a distance d, which costs d volume of water. When the camel has v volume of water, it can jump to any point, but this reduces the water volume to v/2. Each oasis can refill the camel's water. Determine if it is possible to start from each oasis and visit all oases.
