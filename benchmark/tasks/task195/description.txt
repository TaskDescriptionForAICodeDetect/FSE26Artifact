Problem G: Everything Starts With Your Vote
There is a concept called heuristics, which generally works, although it does not guarantee success. An example of heuristics can be seen in anime, where a character's popularity is often proportional to their total screen time. While this seems to be true for many cases, there are fans of less popular characters who believe their favorites are charming despite their limited screen time. Unfortunately, related products such as figures and character songs are primarily released for popular characters. Thus, popularity voting conducted by anime production companies becomes crucial. Each time a related product is bought, a vote gets issued. Given that you have L votes, there are N characters, and the top K characters receiving votes will have their products made. You want to maximize the number of your M favorite characters in the top K. You have predicted how many votes each character would receive based on their screen time. With L votes, you must decide how to allocate them to help your favorites enter the top K positions.
