Create a program to help two brothers, Ichiro and Jiro, determine the maximum number of dolls that can be included in a new Matryoshka doll constructed from their respective sets of dolls. Each doll can hold other dolls as long as the height and radius constraints are satisfied: a doll of height h and radius r can only contain dolls with height less than h and radius less than r. Given the sizes of the dolls for both brothers, compute the maximum possible size k of the new Matryoshka doll set that can be formed by combining their dolls. The input will consist of multiple datasets, each specifying the number of dolls and their respective height and radius attributes, ending with a line containing a single zero.
