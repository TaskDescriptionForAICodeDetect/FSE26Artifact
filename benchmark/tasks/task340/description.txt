You need to write a program that checks if a player's hand in the card game UT-Rummy meets the winning conditions. Each player has 9 cards, and they need to form three sets of three cards each. A set consists of three cards of the same color, which can either be of the same number or in a sequential order. Note that in sequential order, only consecutive numbers are valid; for example, 7, 8, 9 is valid, but 9, 1, 2 is not. You will receive multiple datasets, each containing the number and color of the cards, and you need to determine if the winning conditions are met for each dataset.
