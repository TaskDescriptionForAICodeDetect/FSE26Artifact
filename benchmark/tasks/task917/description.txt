There is a pond shaped as a rectangle, divided into a grid of H rows and W columns. Some squares contain a lotus leaf, and among them, two special leaves are marked as S (start) and T (target). The frog starts on leaf S and can jump to any leaf in the same row or column. Your task is to determine if it is possible to remove other leaves (not S or T) so that the frog cannot reach T. If it's possible, find the minimum number of leaves that need to be removed. If it's not possible, return -1.
