You are given a string s of length n. Does a tree with n vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist? The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., n. The edges are numbered 1,2,..., n-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i. If the i-th character in s is 1, we can have a connected component of size i by removing one edge from the tree. If the i-th character in s is 0, we cannot have a connected component of size i by removing any one edge from the tree. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree.
