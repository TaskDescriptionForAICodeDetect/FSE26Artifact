Snuke is introducing a robot arm with m sections and m+1 joints. Each section can be directed in four modes: L (left), R (right), D (down), and U (up), determining the position of the joints in a coordinate plane. The challenge is to determine if it is possible to configure the robot arm such that the position of Joint m matches given target points (X_j, Y_j) by specifying the modes of the sections. If it is possible, output the configuration of the robot arm, including the lengths of the sections and the sequences of modes for reaching each point. If it is not possible, return -1.
