Takahashi has decided to make a Christmas Tree for the Christmas party in AtCoder, Inc. A Christmas Tree is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N and N-1 edges, where the i-th edge connects Vertex a_i and b_i. He would like to make one by specifying two non-negative integers A and B. He needs to prepare A Christmas Paths whose lengths are at most B. A Christmas Path of length X is a graph with X+1 vertices and X edges that connect the vertices in a sequence. The goal is to find the lexicographically smallest pair (A,B) such that he can construct a connected Christmas Tree.
