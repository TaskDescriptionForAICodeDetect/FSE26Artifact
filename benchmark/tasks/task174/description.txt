Write a program to compute the probability of a cleaning robot stopping at the battery room after moving around a house with several rooms. The robot operates under certain conditions, such as battery consumption and inability to enter a junk room. The program should process multiple datasets, each specifying the initial battery points and the robot's starting position, the position of the battery room, and the junk room. The input terminates with a dataset containing a single zero for the battery points, which should not be processed.
