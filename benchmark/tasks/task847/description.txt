There are 2N balls, N white and N black, arranged in a row. Each white ball has an integer from 1 to N written on it, and each black ball has the same integers written on them. The goal is to arrange the balls such that for every pair of integers (i, j) with 1 ≤ i < j ≤ N, the white ball with i is to the left of the white ball with j, and similarly for the black balls. You can swap two adjacent balls to achieve this. Determine the minimum number of swaps needed.
