Takahashi and Aoki are taking N exams and they wish to compete with each other. For each exam, Takahashi can assign an importance value to the exam, which is an integer within a given range. The winner is determined by calculating a weighted score for both based on these importance values and their respective exam scores. Takahashi starts with a score of 0 on all exams and can increase his score by studying, but he cannot exceed a maximum score limit per exam. The goal is to determine the minimum number of hours Takahashi needs to study in order to secure a win against Aoki.
