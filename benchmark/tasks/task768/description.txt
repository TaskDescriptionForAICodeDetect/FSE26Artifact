We have a grid of squares with N rows and M columns. Let (i, j) denote the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left. We will choose K of the squares and place a piece on each of them. The cost of this arrangement is computed as the sum of the absolute differences in their row and column indices. Find the sum of the costs of all possible arrangements of the pieces, and print this value modulo 10^9+7.
