Nathan O. Davis is trying to add a threaded view feature to his electronic bulletin board system, JAG-channel. Your task is to write a program that prints a tree representation of posts in this threaded view format, where each reply is indented with dots according to its depth in the thread. The input includes an integer followed by pairs of integers and messages, representing the reply structure of the posts. Your goal is to output the messages in the specified format, indented based on their hierarchical relationship.
