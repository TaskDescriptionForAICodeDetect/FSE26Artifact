There are N integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i. Takahashi will arrange these integers as he wishes. Then, Aoki will repeatedly swap two adjacent integers that are coprime, as many times as he wishes. Find the eventual sequence that will be produced, assuming Takahashi acts optimally to achieve a lexicographically smallest sequence and Aoki acts optimally to achieve a lexicographically largest sequence.
