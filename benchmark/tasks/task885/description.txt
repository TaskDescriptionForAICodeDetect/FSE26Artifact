There are N lines in the xy-plane, represented by the equations A_ix + B_iy = C_i. For each pair of lines, a car is located at the intersection point. The goal is to determine the optimal location for an exhibition of these cars such that the total distance moved by all cars to this location is minimized. In case of ties, the location with the smallest x-coordinate and then y-coordinate is preferred. The function should take the number of lines and their coefficients and return the optimal x and y coordinates for the exhibition.
