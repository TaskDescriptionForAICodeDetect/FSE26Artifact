There is a unique study group operated by students at Akabe High School, a programmer training school. The goal of this activity is to cultivate self-study habits through this study group, where programmers continually embrace new technologies. There are N students, each having a score based on their results from an entrance programming contest. Some of the students become leaders, managing their respective groups while also participating in them. Non-leader students cannot join groups led by leaders with a higher score than their own, and a certain value r is set such that the difference between the scores of participating students and their leaders is within r. You are the head of the study group, tasked with simulating operations that involve adding and removing leaders and checking the minimum value of r required to ensure that no more than x students cannot participate in any group. You must create a program to perform this simulation.
