Given a sequence of positive integers and a positive integer L, find the number of subsequences that belong to level (K, L) for some positive integer K. A sequence belongs to level (k, l) if it either has length 1 and equals k or can be constructed from sequences belonging to level (k-1, l) through concatenation, with at least l sequences. The first condition applies only when k = 1, where the sequence must equal 1.
