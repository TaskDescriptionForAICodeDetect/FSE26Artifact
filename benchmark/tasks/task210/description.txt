Mr. Frugal wants to cover all scratched panels in his living room with the minimum number of square carpets. Each carpet can overlap, but it cannot cover any flawless panels. You are to write a program that calculates the minimum number of carpets needed for a given set of floor panels, represented by a grid of integers where '0' indicates a flawless panel and '1' indicates a scratched panel. The input consists of multiple test cases, each starting with two integers indicating the width and height of the grid, followed by the grid's rows. The input ends with a line containing two zeros.
