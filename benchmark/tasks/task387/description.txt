Cache Strategy Problem: In a memory where the cost of reading varies by block, devise the best cache strategy under full associative caching given all possible memory accesses in advance. You have M boxes and N balls, with each ball numbered from 1 to N and having a specified weight. Given a sequence of K integers representing operations to place balls into boxes, compute the minimum sum of costs incurred while managing these operations.
