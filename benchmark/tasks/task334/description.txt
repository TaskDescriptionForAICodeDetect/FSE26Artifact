You need to write a program that decrypts an encrypted message by extracting the longest palindrome subsequence from a given string of capital letters. A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same in either direction, and words or phrases made of only one or two letters are not regarded as palindromes. Given multiple datasets of strings, each up to 2000 characters long, your program should return the longest palindrome subsequence for each string, outputting them on separate lines.
