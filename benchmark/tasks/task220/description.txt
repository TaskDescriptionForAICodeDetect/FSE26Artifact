In the game 'Roll-A-Big-Ball', players roll a ball on a straight course, avoiding rectangular blocks as obstacles. The goal is to determine the largest radius of the ball that can be rolled from a starting point to an endpoint without colliding with any blocks. Each dataset specifies the number of blocks, the start and end points of the course, and the dimensions and heights of the blocks. The output should be the largest radius for each dataset, ensuring the ball's bottom point does not leave the course.
