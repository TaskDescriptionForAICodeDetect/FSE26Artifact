You are given a tree with N vertices and an integer K. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N. The edges are represented by pairs of integers (a_i, b_i). For a set S of vertices in the tree, let f(S) be the minimum number of vertices in a subtree of the given tree that contains all vertices in S. You need to find the sum of f(S) over all ways to choose K vertices from the trees, for K ranging from 1 to N. Since the answer may be extremely large, print it modulo 924844033 (a prime number).
