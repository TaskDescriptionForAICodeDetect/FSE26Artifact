The task involves counting the number of genetic sequences (strings made of 'A', 'T', 'G', 'C') that adhere to given syntax rules. The strings must contain exactly Na occurrences of 'A', Nt occurrences of 'T', Ng occurrences of 'G', and Nc occurrences of 'C'. The syntax rules are defined using non-terminal symbols that expand into terminal and other non-terminal symbols. The goal is to find the total such sequences and return the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
