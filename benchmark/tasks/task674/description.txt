You start with the number 0 and want to reach the number N. You can change the number by performing operations that cost a certain number of coins. The operations are: multiply by 2 (cost A coins), multiply by 3 (cost B coins), multiply by 5 (cost C coins), and increase or decrease by 1 (cost D coins). You can perform these operations in any order and any number of times. The goal is to find the minimum number of coins needed to reach N. You need to solve T test cases.
