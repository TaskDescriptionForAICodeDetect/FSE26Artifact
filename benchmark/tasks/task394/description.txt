N people run a marathon. There are M resting places along the route. For each resting place, the i-th runner takes a break with probability P_i percent. When the i-th runner takes a break, he rests for T_i time. The i-th runner runs at a constant speed V_i, and the marathon distance is L. You are required to compute the probability for each runner to win first place. If a runner arrives at the finish line at the same time as another runner, they are not considered to win. The input consists of the number of runners N, the number of resting places M, and the distance L, followed by N lines each describing the probability P_i, the resting time T_i, and the speed V_i for each runner. The output should be the probability of winning for each runner, with a precision error not greater than 10^-5.
