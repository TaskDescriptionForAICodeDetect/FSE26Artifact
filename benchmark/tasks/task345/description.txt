Twins Rin and Len are searching for treasure in a mirror cave. The cave has paired rooms with doors leading to valuable treasure. To unlock the door to the treasure room, both twins must move in a symmetrical manner and reach a specific cell simultaneously. If one twin reaches the destination first, the door will lock and cannot be opened. Symmetrical movement means that both twins move north together, east together, and so on, but if one twin encounters a wall while the other does not, then the twin with the wall stays in place while the other moves. You need to determine whether it is possible for the twins to unlock the door given their initial positions, destination, and obstacles in the cave.
