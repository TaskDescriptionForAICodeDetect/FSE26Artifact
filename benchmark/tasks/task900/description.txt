Let N be a positive even number. We have a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N), p = (p_1, p_2, ..., p_N). Snuke is constructing another permutation of (1, 2, ..., N), q, following the procedure below. First, let q be an empty sequence. Then, perform the following operation until p becomes empty: Select two adjacent elements in p, and call them x and y in order. Remove x and y from p (reducing the length of p by 2), and insert x and y, preserving the original order, at the beginning of q. When p becomes empty, q will be a permutation of (1, 2, ..., N). Find the lexicographically smallest permutation that can be obtained as q.
