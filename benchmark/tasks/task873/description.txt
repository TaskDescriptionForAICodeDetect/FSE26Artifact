Snuke has an integer sequence, a, of length N. The i-th element of a (1-indexed) is a_i. He can perform the operation of choosing integers x and y between 1 and N (inclusive) and adding a_x to a_y any number of times between 0 and 2N, so that the sequence satisfies a_1 ≤ a_2 ≤ ... ≤ a_N. Show one such sequence of operations. It can be proved that such a sequence of operations always exists under the constraints in this problem.
