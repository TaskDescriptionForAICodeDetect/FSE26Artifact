There is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N. The i-th of the N-1 edges connects vertices a_i and b_i. Initially, each edge is painted blue. Takahashi will convert this blue tree into a red tree by performing the following operation N-1 times: Select a simple path that consists of only blue edges, and remove one of those edges. Then, span a new red edge between the two endpoints of the selected path. His objective is to obtain a tree that has a red edge connecting vertices c_i and d_i, for each i. Determine whether this is achievable.
