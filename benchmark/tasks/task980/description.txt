On an xy plane, in an area defined by the conditions 0 ≤ x ≤ W and 0 ≤ y ≤ H, there exists one house at every point where both x and y are integers. There are unpaved roads between every pair of points where the x coordinates are equal and the difference between the y coordinates is 1, or the y coordinates are equal and the difference between the x coordinates is 1. The cost of paving a road between houses at coordinates (i,j) and (i+1,j) is p_i for any value of j, while the cost of paving a road between houses at coordinates (i,j) and (i,j+1) is q_j for any value of i. Mr. Takahashi wants to pave some of these roads such that it is possible to travel between any two houses using only paved roads. Your task is to find the solution with the minimum total cost.
