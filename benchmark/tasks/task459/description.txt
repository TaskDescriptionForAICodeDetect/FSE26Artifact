Nathan O. Davis needs to write a program to process an audio signal that has been corrupted. Each audio signal sample is either an integer or marked as broken by an 'x'. Odd-numbered samples must be less than their neighbors, and even-numbered samples must be greater than theirs. Your task is to determine if the missing samples can be recovered uniquely or if there are multiple possible values, or if recovery is impossible.
