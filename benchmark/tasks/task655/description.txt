We have a grid of H rows and W columns of squares. Each square can either be white (represented by '.') or black (represented by '#'). You can choose some rows and columns to paint red, and your goal is to find out how many combinations of row and column selections will result in exactly K black squares remaining after painting. You need to return the number of different selections of rows and columns that meet this condition.
