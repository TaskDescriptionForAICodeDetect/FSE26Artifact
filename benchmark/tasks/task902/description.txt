Given a directed graph with N vertices and N edges, where the vertices are numbered from 1 to N and the graph is weakly connected, assign a non-negative integer value to each vertex such that: (1) values of connected vertices are not equal, and (2) for every integer x in the range from 0 to the value of vertex i, there exists a vertex j connected to i such that the value of vertex j equals x. Determine if such an assignment is possible.
