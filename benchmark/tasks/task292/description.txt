Starting a Scenic Railroad Service: Jim is responsible for planning a new tourist train service and wants to estimate the minimum number of train seats required based on a market survey of passengers' travel sections. The task is to compute the number of seats needed under two different seat reservation policies. The first policy (policy-1) allows passengers to choose any remaining seat when making reservations, while the second policy (policy-2) assigns seats after all reservations are completed. Given the number of passengers and their travel information, the output should return the number of seats required for both policies.
