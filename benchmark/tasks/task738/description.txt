There are N positive integers arranged in a circle. The i-th number is A_i, and Takahashi wants the i-th number to be B_i. He can repeatedly select an integer i (1 â‰¤ i â‰¤ N) and replace the i-th number with the sum of its two neighboring numbers (the (i-1)-th and the (i+1)-th), where the 0-th number is considered to be the N-th number, and the (N+1)-th number is the 1-st number. Determine if Takahashi can achieve his objective. If yes, find the minimum number of operations required.
