The goal of the 8 puzzle problem is to arrange the pieces on a 3x3 grid where one cell is empty. The empty space is represented by 0 and the pieces are represented by integers from 1 to 8. You can move a piece into the empty space in one step. Your task is to find the fewest moves required to reach a specific target configuration. Write a program that reads an initial state of the puzzle and prints the minimum number of steps needed to solve it.
