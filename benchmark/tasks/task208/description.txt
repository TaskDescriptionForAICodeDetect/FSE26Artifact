Your job is to find out the secret number hidden in a matrix. Each element of the matrix is a digit ('0'-'9') or a letter ('A'-'Z'). The secret number is the largest number formed by sequences of digits in the matrix, where adjacent digits are considered either right next to or immediately below each other. The program should read multiple datasets, each representing a matrix, and output the secret number for each dataset. Leading zeros should be suppressed in the output.
