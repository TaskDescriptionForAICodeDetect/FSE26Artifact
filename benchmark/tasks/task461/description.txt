You need to determine the maximum number of different SIRO restaurants Jiro can visit within a limited time while traveling between railway stations in a city. Starting from a specified station, he can move between directly connected stations for certain amounts of time, and each restaurant has a specific time required for eating ramen. Jiro needs to return to the starting station before the time limit expires, and he cannot visit the restaurant located at the starting station. The problem requires handling multiple datasets with specific constraints on the number of stations, connections, and restaurants.
