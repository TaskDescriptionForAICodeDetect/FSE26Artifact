You need to design a program that plans rolling blackouts for a power company. The goal is to divide a rectangular servicing area into groups of towns based on their electricity demand, ensuring that the total demand of all groups except one does not exceed the supply capacity. The grouping must be done by recursively splitting the area horizontally or vertically. Additionally, the grouping should have the maximum number of groups possible, and among those groupings, the one with the greatest reserve power (the difference between the supply capacity and the maximum suppressed demand) should be chosen.
