A pastry chef has made several roll cakes of various sizes. You are tasked to arrange these cakes in a box. Because the roll cakes are very soft, they can get crushed if other cakes are placed on top of them, so all cakes must be placed flat on the bottom of the box, ensuring they are in contact with its bottom surface. Rearranging the cakes may change the required width. You need to read the radii of the n roll cakes (r1, r2, ..., rn) and the length of the box. For each arrangement, determine if it fits in the box. If an arrangement works, output 'OK'; if it is impossible to fit them no matter how you arrange them, output 'NA'. The cross-section of the roll cake is circular, and the box's walls are sufficiently tall. The radius of each roll cake is an integer between 3 and 10. The input consists of multiple datasets, with each dataset starting with an integer W (length of the box) followed by the radii of the roll cakes, which are integers separated by spaces. The number of cakes n is at most 12, and there can be up to 50 datasets. For each dataset, output 'OK' or 'NA' on a single line.
