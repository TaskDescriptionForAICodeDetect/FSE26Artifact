The problem is about checking for contradictions in unit relationships expressed in powers of ten. A given input specifies several relations between different units in the form '1 A = 10^x B'. The task is to determine whether these relations are consistent or contradictory. A relation is considered contradictory if there exist two different equations for the same pair of units that imply different powers of ten between them.
