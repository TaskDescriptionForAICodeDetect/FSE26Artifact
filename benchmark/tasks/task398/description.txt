You need to implement a routine that optimizes the strategy of the white bird to defeat a pig by hitting an egg bomb. The white bird follows a parabolic trajectory from the origin and can drop egg bombs vertically. The path of the white bird may be obstructed by rectangular obstacles. You need to determine whether the white bird can drop an egg bomb towards the pig's position (X, Y) without colliding with any obstacles. The input consists of the number of obstacles, the initial speed of the white bird, and the coordinates of the pig, along with the coordinates of the obstacles. The output should be 'Yes' if the white bird can drop the egg bomb and 'No' otherwise.
