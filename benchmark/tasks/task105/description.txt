In a remote forest, there lived a witch named Marie who used magic to obtain essentials for living. Her magic was activated by drawing a magic circle using some stones and strings, where the stones are placed and pairs of stones are connected by strings. However, several constraints must be followed: no strings should be slack, no string should touch other strings or stones except at its ends, more than one stone cannot occupy the same position, and Marie cannot connect the same pair of stones with more than one string, nor can a string connect both ends to the same stone. Marie initially drew these magic circles on a flat wall, but later discovered that certain circles could not be drawn in a two-dimensional plane under specific conditions, such as using a complete graph with 5 vertices or a complete bipartite graph with 3 vertices each. To overcome this, she developed a magic to fix stones in the air, allowing the circles to be drawn in three-dimensional space. The task is to determine if a given magic circle with `n` stones and `m` strings can be drawn on a one-dimensional line, given input datasets that specify the number of stones and strings along with string connections. For each dataset, output 'yes' if the magic circle can be drawn on the line and 'no' if it cannot.
