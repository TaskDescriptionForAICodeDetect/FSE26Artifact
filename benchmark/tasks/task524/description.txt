AOR is using a dial lock on her treasure chest. The lock has N cylinders, and it can be unlocked if the numbers displayed on the cylinders match a pre-set code T consisting of N numbers. The cylinders are marked with M different numbers (from 0 to M-1) and all cylinders initially show 0. A special feature of the lock is that AOR cannot turn the cylinders one by one; instead, she must select two different cylinders and turn them simultaneously. A turn consists of choosing two distinct cylinders and turning both either clockwise (increasing the number by 1) or counterclockwise (decreasing the number by 1). If a cylinder is at 0 and turned counterclockwise, it shows M-1; if it is at M-1 and turned clockwise, it shows 0. Determine the minimum number of turns required to open the lock. If the lock cannot be opened, output -1.
