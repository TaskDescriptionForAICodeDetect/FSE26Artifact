You are playing a game called Guru Guru Gururin. In this game, you can control a vehicle called Gururin using two commands: 'R' for rotating clockwise by 90 degrees and 'L' for rotating counterclockwise by 90 degrees. The goal is to determine how many times Gururin gains magical power by following a set of commands. Gururin gains magical power if it starts facing north, ends facing north, and does not face north in between except for the start and end. You need to count how many complete sequences of commands that meet these criteria are present in the input command sequence.
