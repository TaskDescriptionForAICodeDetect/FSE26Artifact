On a two-dimensional plane, there are N red points and N blue points. The coordinates of the i-th red point are (a_i, b_i), and the coordinates of the i-th blue point are (c_i, d_i). A red point and a blue point can form a friendly pair when the x-coordinate of the red point is smaller than that of the blue point, and the y-coordinate of the red point is also smaller than that of the blue point. At most how many friendly pairs can you form? Note that a point cannot belong to multiple pairs.
