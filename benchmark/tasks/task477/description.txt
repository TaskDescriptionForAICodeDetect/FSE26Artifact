Fox Ciel is developing an AI for a game represented as a game tree T with n vertices. Each node has an evaluation value that represents the quality of a situation, derived from the maximum value of its child nodes multiplied by -1. Leaf nodes are evaluated using a special function, which is computationally intensive. To optimize calculations, Ciel wants to determine the minimum and maximum number of evaluations needed for leaf nodes, given that the order of evaluating child nodes can vary. The input format includes the number of vertices, evaluation values, and the structure of the game tree. The task is to output the minimum and maximum evaluation counts for the leaf nodes.
