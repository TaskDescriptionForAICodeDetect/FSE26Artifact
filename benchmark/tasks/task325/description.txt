Nate U. Smith runs a railway company in a metropolitan area where there is competition from other railway companies. Nate has decided to create a new railway route between two developing blocks, A and B. This new route cannot be entirely elevated or underground due to existing lines. The route must adapt its elevation when intersecting with existing lines from the same company or a competitor. Your task is to determine the minimum number of entrances needed for the new route based on given coordinates and existing line information.
