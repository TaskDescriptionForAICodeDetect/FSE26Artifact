Write a program that simulates a dealer in a game of blackjack and calculates the dealer's score after playing according to specific rules. The dealer starts with two cards and then draws additional cards from a pile if necessary, based on their current score. The dealer wins if their score is close to 21 without exceeding it, and specific scoring rules apply for different card values.
