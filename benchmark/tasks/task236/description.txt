A mobile phone company ACMICPC is trying to determine the best collection of antenna locations in the city of Maxnorm. Each antenna has a power indicating its coverage radius, which forms a square area for coverage instead of a circular one, based on the L-infinity norm. The program should calculate the total area covered by at least one antenna for given datasets of antenna locations.
