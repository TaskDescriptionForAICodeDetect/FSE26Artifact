Taro-kun is playing a puzzle where he needs to place the numbers from 1 to 9 in a 9x9 grid according to specific rules. The rules state that each number must appear exactly once in each column, exactly once in each row, and exactly once in each 3x3 sub-grid outlined by double lines. You need to create a program that reads the placement of numbers and checks if they follow these rules. If any number appears more than once, it should be preceded by an asterisk (*) in the output; if it appears correctly, it should be preceded by a space. Multiple datasets will be provided, with the first line containing the number of datasets (n <= 20) followed by 9 lines representing the state of the puzzle. Output the corrected lines with asterisks and spaces as required, inserting a blank line between outputs of different datasets.
