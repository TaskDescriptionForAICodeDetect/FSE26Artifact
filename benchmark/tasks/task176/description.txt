In the Indian Puzzle, you need to fill in the blanks of an n by n grid with numbers (0 to 9 inclusive) and operators (+, -, *, /) to create valid equalities. A valid equality must be formed using all provided numbers and operators according to standard mathematical precedence. The grid contains some pre-filled cells and some cells are blank (represented by '.'). Black cells (represented by '#') separate different equalities. Your task is to determine whether the provided puzzle is solvable or not.
