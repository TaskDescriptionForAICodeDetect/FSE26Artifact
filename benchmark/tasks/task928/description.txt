There is a circle with a circumference of L. Each point on the circumference has a coordinate value, representing the arc length from a reference point clockwise to that point. N ants are on this circumference, each located at a coordinate X_i. The ants move either clockwise or counterclockwise based on their initial direction. When two ants bump into each other, they turn around and walk in the opposite direction. The task is to determine the position of each ant after T seconds.
