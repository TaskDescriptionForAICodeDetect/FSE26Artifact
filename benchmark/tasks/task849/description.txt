In the problem, Nakahashi enters a Japanese restaurant with a round counter that has a circumference of C meters and N pieces of sushi placed along it. The distance from Nakahashi's current position to each sushi is given, along with their nutritional values. As Nakahashi walks around the counter, he consumes 1 kilocalorie for each meter walked. The task is to determine the maximum net nutrition (total nutrition minus total energy consumed) that Nakahashi can achieve before leaving the restaurant. He can leave at any point and does not have to return to his starting position. The goal is to find the optimal path to maximize the net nutrition collected.
