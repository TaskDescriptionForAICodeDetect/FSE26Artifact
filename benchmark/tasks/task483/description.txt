Chopsticks Problem. A student has noticed that there are an odd number of chopsticks in their holder. To avoid this issue in the future, they decide to record the number of chopsticks each day using the remainders of dividing by certain integers. Given a list of recorded remainders over several days, your task is to determine the maximum possible number of chopsticks remaining on the final day, or output -1 if there are inconsistencies in the recorded data.
