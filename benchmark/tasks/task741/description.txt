Given a string S consisting of characters 'L' and 'R', where 'R' is always the leftmost character and 'L' is always the rightmost character, determine the number of children standing on each square after they perform moves according to the characters in the string for up to 10^100 times. Each child moves in the direction specified by the character on their square ('L' means move left, 'R' means move right). Count the number of children remaining on each square after all moves.
