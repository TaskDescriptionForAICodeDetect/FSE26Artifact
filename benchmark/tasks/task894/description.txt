In the city of Nevermore, there are 10^8 streets and 10^8 avenues, both numbered from 0 to 10^8-1. All streets run straight from west to east, and all avenues run straight from south to north. The distance between neighboring streets and neighboring avenues is exactly 100 meters. Every street intersects every avenue, and each intersection can be described by a pair (x, y), where x is avenue ID and y is street ID. There are N fountains in the city, situated at intersections (X_i, Y_i). Each street contains at most one fountain, as does every avenue. Citizens can move along streets, avenues and fountain perimeters. The task is to determine the shortest distance one needs to cover in order to get from intersection (x_1, y_1) to intersection (x_2, y_2). The intersections (x_1, y_1) and (x_2, y_2) do not contain fountains and are different.
