In the year 2020, a race of atomically energized cars will take place. The cars run without the need for fuel, but teams must manage tire changes at checkpoints. Each checkpoint has a specific distance, and teams can choose whether to change tires at each. Changing tires takes a certain amount of time, and different time calculations apply depending on the distance traveled since the last tire change. The goal is to write a program that determines the best strategy for changing tires to minimize the total time to reach the final checkpoint.
