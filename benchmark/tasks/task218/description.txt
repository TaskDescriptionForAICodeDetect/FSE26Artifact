In a three-valued logic system where the values are represented as 'false' (0), 'unknown' (1), and 'true' (2), determine the number of triples (P, Q, R) that satisfy a given logical formula such that the formula evaluates to true (2). The allowed operators are negation (-), conjunction (*), and disjunction (+). Each input formula will be a string consisting only of 0, 1, 2, P, Q, R, -, *, +, (, and ). The input ends with a period ('.'). Output the count of satisfying triples for each formula.
