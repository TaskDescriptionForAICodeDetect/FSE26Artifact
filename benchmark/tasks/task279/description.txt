Given a set of triples defined as (x, y, z), you need to find the length of the longest ascending series of triples based on a partial order defined by (xa < xb and ya < yb and za < zb). The input consists of multiple datasets, each specifying a number of triples, including both explicitly given and generated triples using the parameters A and B. The output should be the length of the longest ascending series for each dataset.
