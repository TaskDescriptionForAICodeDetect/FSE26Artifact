Snuke received N intervals as a birthday present. The i-th interval was [-L_i, R_i]. It is guaranteed that both L_i and R_i are positive. Snuke doesn't like overlapping intervals, so he decided to move some intervals. For any positive integer d, if he pays d dollars, he can choose one of the intervals and move it by the distance of d. That is, if the chosen segment is [a, b], he can change it to either [a+d, b+d] or [a-d, b-d]. He can repeat this type of operation an arbitrary number of times. After the operations, the intervals must be pairwise disjoint (however, they may touch at a point). Formally, for any two intervals, the length of the intersection must be zero. Compute the minimum cost required to achieve his goal.
