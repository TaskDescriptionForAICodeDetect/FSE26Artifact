A robot is placed in a two-dimensional maze and must navigate through it based on its initial position, direction, and a specified number of steps. The robot can only move forward into empty cells, and must rotate 90 degrees to the right upon encountering walls or the maze's edges. The task is to calculate the robot's final position and direction after executing its movement commands.
