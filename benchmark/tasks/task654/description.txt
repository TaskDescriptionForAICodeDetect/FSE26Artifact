You are given the positions (X_i, Y_i) of N enemy rooks on an infinite chessboard. No two rooks attack each other (at most one rook per row or column). You will replace one rook with a king and then move the king repeatedly to beat as many rooks as possible. You cannot enter a cell that is being attacked by a rook. Additionally, you cannot move diagonally to an empty cell (but you can beat a rook diagonally). (Thus, this king moves like a superpawn that beats diagonally in 4 directions and moves horizontally/vertically in 4 directions.) For each rook, consider replacing it with a king, and find the minimum number of moves needed to beat the maximum number of rooks.
