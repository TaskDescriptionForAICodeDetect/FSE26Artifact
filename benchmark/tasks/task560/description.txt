In xryuseix's school, a code has become popular. Living in a grid-like city, xryuseix created a new code to decide a meeting place. The coded message consists of a string S of N characters, where each character S_i determines the direction to move from the current location. The movement directions are as follows: A-M: move 1 square North, N-Z: move 1 square South, a-m: move 1 square East, n-z: move 1 square West. However, xryuseix noticed that the coded message is redundant. For example, the code 'ANA' means moving North 1 square, South 1 square, then North 1 square, which can be simplified to just 'A' (moving North 1 square). Your task is to write a program that simplifies the coded message to generate the shortest code that takes the same final position as the original. Constraints specify that N is an integer, and S_i is an uppercase or lowercase letter of the alphabet, with 1 <= N <= 100000. You will receive N and S as input and should output the length of the simplified coded message on the first line followed by the simplified code on the second line. If there are multiple valid simplified codes, any of them is acceptable. Note that a newline must also be output after an empty string if the simplified code is empty.
