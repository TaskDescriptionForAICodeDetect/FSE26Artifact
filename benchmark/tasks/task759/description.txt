There are N squares arranged in a row, numbered 1 to N from left to right. Takahashi wants to stack blocks evenly on these squares until there are H blocks on every square. He can perform operations to add blocks on squares that have the minimum number of blocks, ensuring the number of blocks on that square stays between the maximum number of blocks and the maximum plus D. Your task is to find out how many ways there are to achieve exactly H blocks on every square by repeating this operation, returning the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
