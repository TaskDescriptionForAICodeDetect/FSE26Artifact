In a certain city, Mr. A's house is surrounded by a completely white wall. Feeling the wall was lacking, Mr. A invited local children to freely paint the wall. Each child can choose any section of the wall to paint. The task is to determine how the wall has been painted. There is a circular white wall consisting of sections labeled from 0 to N-1. M children specify a starting position 'a' and a length 'L' to paint the wall counter-clockwise from position 'a' to (a + L) mod N. Overlapping painted sections can be combined into a single section. The output should show the lengths of the painted sections in descending order and indicate how many sections of each length there are.
