Your task is to implement a doubly linked list. Write a program which performs the following operations: insert x: insert an element with key x into the front of the list. delete x: delete the first element which has the key of x from the list. If there is no such element, you need not do anything. deleteFirst: delete the first element from the list. deleteLast: delete the last element from the list. The input is given in the following format: n followed by n lines of commands. The commands can be 'insert x', 'delete x', 'deleteFirst', or 'deleteLast'. The output should print all the element (key) in the list after the given operations, with two consecutive keys separated by a single space.
