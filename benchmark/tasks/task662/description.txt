Given integers N and K, and a prime number P, find the number, modulo P, of directed graphs G with N vertices that satisfy the following conditions. The vertices are distinguishable, G is a tournament (containing no duplicated edges or self-loops, and exactly one of the edges u→v and v→u exists for any two vertices u and v), the in-degree of every vertex in G is at most K, and for any four distinct vertices a, b, c, and d in G, it is not the case that all of the six edges a→b, b→c, c→a, a→d, b→d, and c→d exist simultaneously.
