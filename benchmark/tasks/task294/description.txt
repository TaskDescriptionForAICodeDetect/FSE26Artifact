Write a program that determines the ordering of file names by interpreting digit sequences as numeric values. File names consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and digits. Number items come before letter items. Letter items are sorted by their ASCII values, and number items are sorted by their decimal values. The input will include a count of file names followed by the file names themselves, and the output will indicate for each file name whether it should come before or after a given reference file name.
