There is a grid with R rows and C columns where some cells contain non-negative integers written by Mr. Takahashi. Mr. Aoki tries to fill in the remaining cells such that two conditions are satisfied: (1) each cell must contain a non-negative integer, and (2) for any 2x2 square formed by the cells, the sum of the top left and bottom right cells must equal the sum of the top right and bottom left cells. Determine if it is possible for Mr. Aoki to fill in the remaining cells according to these conditions.
