You have an integer sequence of length N: a_1, a_2, ..., a_N. You repeatedly perform the following operation until the length of the sequence becomes 1: First, choose an element of the sequence. If that element is at either end of the sequence, delete the element. If that element is not at either end of the sequence, replace the element with the sum of the two elements that are adjacent to it. Then, delete those two elements. You would like to maximize the final element that remains in the sequence. Find the maximum possible value of the final element, and the way to achieve it.
