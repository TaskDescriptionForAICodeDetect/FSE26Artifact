In this puzzle task, you are given a 3D cube made of 27 dice, and the goal is to determine all plausible arrangements of these dice based on provided top and front views. The rules dictate that for adjacent faces of the dice, the numbers must sum to seven. Your program should calculate the sum of the numbers on the right side of the cube for each valid arrangement and return the sums in ascending order, without duplicates. If no arrangements are possible for a dataset, the output should be zero.
