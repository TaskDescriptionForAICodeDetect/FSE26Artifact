Dice Stamp

You have discovered a game at a local festival involving rolling N six-sided dice on a board. Each of the N dice is associated with a corresponding button. Pressing a button drops the associated die onto the board, and the objective of the game is to score points by pressing the buttons up to N times. Each die has faces with integers that don't necessarily range from 1 to 6, and the scoring is determined by the number on the bottom face of the die when it comes to rest on the board. After pressing a button N times, the total score on the board is calculated. Each die's drop position, orientation, and subsequent rotations are predetermined. Your task is to determine the maximum possible score based on the best sequence of button presses, given complete information about the dice and their behaviors.
