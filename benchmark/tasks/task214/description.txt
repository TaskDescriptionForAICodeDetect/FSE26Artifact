The task is to develop a program that calculates the minimum number of moves a cleaning robot needs to change all dirty tiles in a rectangular room to clean tiles. The room is represented as a grid, where certain tiles are clean, dirty, or occupied by furniture which the robot cannot access. The robot moves to adjacent tiles and may revisit tiles, but must navigate obstacles. The goal is to determine the minimum moves required or to indicate if it's impossible to clean all dirty tiles.
