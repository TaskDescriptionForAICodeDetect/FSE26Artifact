You are running a restaurant that serves breakfast, lunch, and supper three times a day. Each customer has their own separate time zones for eating these meals. The goal is to modify your serving time to maximize the number of customers that can enjoy all three meals. You are given a list of customers' meal time zones which you cannot change. Your task is to write a program that determines the maximum number of customers that can be served all three meals.
