Given a permutation of integers from 1 to N and an integer K, Maroon performs a series of shuffling operations on subsequences of the permutation. The task is to find the expected value of the inversion number of the sequence after all operations, and print it modulo 998244353. The inversion number is defined as the number of ordered pairs (i, j) such that i < j and a_i > a_j. The expected value can be represented as a fraction P/Q, and the output should be the integer R that satisfies R × Q ≡ P (mod 998244353) with 0 ≤ R < 998244353.
