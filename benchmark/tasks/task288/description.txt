Your pet monkey George has escaped in a maze-like building with many rooms. Some doors are one-way, and George randomly picks a door to enter an adjacent room. He does not return immediately through the door he just came from, but may return through other doors. Your goal is to calculate how long it may take before George is confined in a room. You must consider all the possibilities of the room he is initially in and all his choices of doors. If he can keep hopping around without being caught, output 'Infinite'.
