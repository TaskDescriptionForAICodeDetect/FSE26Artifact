Consider sets of natural numbers. Some sets can be sorted in the same order numerically and lexicographically. Your task is to write a program that, for the set of integers in a given range [A, B] (i.e. between A and B inclusive), counts the number of non-empty subsets satisfying the above property. The output should be the number of the subsets modulo P given as the input. The input consists of multiple datasets with three integers A, B, and P. The process ends with a line containing three zeros.
