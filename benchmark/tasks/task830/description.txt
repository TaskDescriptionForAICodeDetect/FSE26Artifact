You are given an integer L. Construct a directed graph that satisfies the following conditions: The number of vertices, N, is at most 20, and the number of edges, M, is at most 60. Each edge has an integer length between 0 and 10^6 (inclusive) and is directed from the vertex with the smaller ID to the vertex with the larger ID. There must be exactly L different paths from Vertex 1 to Vertex N, and the lengths of these paths must all be different integers between 0 and L-1. The length of a path is the sum of the lengths of the edges in that path, and paths are considered different if they contain different sets of edges. Output the number of vertices and edges, followed by M lines describing each edge.
