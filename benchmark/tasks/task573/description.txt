Your task is to write a program that sorts a given set of cards in ascending order by their values using both the Bubble Sort algorithm and the Selection Sort algorithm. Each card has a suit (S, H, C, D) and a value (1 to 9), represented in the format 'SuitValue' (e.g., 'H8' for 'eight of hearts'). Report the stability of the output for each sorting algorithm, where stability means that cards with the same value appear in the same order in the output as they do in the input.
