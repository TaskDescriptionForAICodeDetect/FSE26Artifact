Create a program that calculates the positions where axion particles should pass through a 10x10 array of photomultiplier tubes in order to turn off all of them. The input consists of the state of the tubes (0 for off, 1 for on). The output should also be a 10x10 array that indicates which tubes the axion particles will pass through (1 for passing, 0 for not passing). There will always be exactly one way to turn off all the tubes.
