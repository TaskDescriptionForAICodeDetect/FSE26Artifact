You and your friends, who are confident that you will fail the arithmetic test, decide to cheat by stealing the handwriting of your teacher, Mr. A, who is known for writing test papers by hand. However, a programmer is needed to create a program that can reconstruct the problems from the handwriting information, which is provided as a set of line segments on a grid. The problems consist of arithmetic expressions using the operators + (addition), - (subtraction), and Â· (multiplication), with multiplication having higher precedence than addition and subtraction. The expressions are guaranteed to be syntactically correct and will not contain numbers with leading zeros. Given the line segments, the task is to reconstruct the expression they represent and evaluate it.
