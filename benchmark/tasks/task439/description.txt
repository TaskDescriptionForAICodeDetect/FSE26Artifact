YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language) is a format for representing objects as strings. Given an object represented in a subset of YAML and a query specifying a property, return the value of the specified property. The subset of YAML is defined using an extended BNF notation, adhering to specific syntax rules that allow for nested mappings. A property query is presented in the form '.key_1.key_2(...).key_n', which represents a sequence of properties to access values within the YAML object. If the specified property does not exist, return 'no such property'. If the property value is an object, return 'object'. If the property value is a string, return 'string "<content>"'.
