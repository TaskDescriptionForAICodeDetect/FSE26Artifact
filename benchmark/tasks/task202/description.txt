You need to write a program to determine if two key descriptions represent the same key. Each key is represented by a list of paths made up of gold bars. The paths are defined using a sequence of symbols indicating directions and positive integers representing labels for the endpoints of the bars. You will receive several pairs of key descriptions and must output 'SAME' if they represent the same key and 'DIFFERENT' if they do not. You must ensure that no two gold bars occupy the same position.
