In the Takahashi Kingdom, there are N cities connected by bidirectional roads, and it is known that people could travel between any pair of cities through these roads. Given a matrix A representing the shortest distances between the cities, the task is to determine if a valid network of roads exists such that for every pair of cities u and v, the value A[u][v] is equal to the shortest path between them. If such a network is possible, calculate the shortest possible total length of the roads. If it's not possible, return -1.
