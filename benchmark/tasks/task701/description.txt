Snuke is standing on a two-dimensional plane. In one operation, he can move by 1 in the positive x-direction, or move by 1 in the positive y-direction. Define a function f(r, c) as the number of paths from the point (0, 0) to the point (r, c). Given four integers r_1, r_2, c_1, and c_2, find the sum of f(i, j) for all pairs of integers (i, j) such that r_1 ≤ i ≤ r_2 and c_1 ≤ j ≤ c_2, and compute this value modulo (10^9+7).
