Takahashi has decided to give a string to his mother. The value of a string T is defined as the length of the longest common subsequence of T and T', where T' is the reversed string of T. Takahashi has a string S and he is allowed to change at most K characters in S to any other characters to maximize the value. The goal is to find the highest possible value achievable after making these changes.
