Mr. Tanaka passed away, leaving behind an orchard divided into H x W sections planted with apples, persimmons, and oranges. His will states that the orchard should be divided among as many relatives as possible, but if any neighboring sections contain the same type of fruit, they should be treated as one large section due to indistinguishable boundaries. Your task is to read the orchard's map and determine the number of sections that can be distributed to relatives. Each dataset starts with the dimensions H and W followed by H strings representing the orchard, containing only the characters '@' for apples, '#' for persimmons, and '*' for oranges. The input ends with two zeros. Output the number of sections for each dataset, one per line.
