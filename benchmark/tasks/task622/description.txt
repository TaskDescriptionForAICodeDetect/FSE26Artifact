Find bridges of an undirected graph G(V, E). A bridge (also known as a cut-edge) is an edge whose deletion increases the number of connected components. The input will consist of the number of nodes |V| and the number of edges |E|, followed by |E| pairs of integers representing the source and target nodes of each edge. The output should be a list of bridges in the graph, ordered by their names. For each bridge, the names of its endpoints should be printed in ascending order, separated by a space.
