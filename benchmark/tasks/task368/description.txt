F, who loves dancing, decided to practice a hardcore dance called JUMPSTYLE at a dance hall. The dance floor is tiled in an NÃ—N grid. Each tile has coordinates indicating which tile to jump to for the next step. F is capable of jumping to any tile on the floor due to strong athletic skills gained from daily practice. F realizes that after enough time, they will eventually enter a steady state, looping through the same route repeatedly. F wonders how many such loops exist on this floor and turns to you, a programmer, for help.
