A Short Phrase (aka. Tanku) is a fixed verse, inspired by Japanese poetry Tanka and Haiku. It is a sequence of words, each consisting of lowercase letters 'a' to 'z', and must satisfy the condition of having the total number of letters in five sections: 5 letters in the first section, 7 in the second, and 5, 7, and 7 in the subsequent sections. The task is to find the Short Phrase from a sequence of words that may contain irrelevant prefixes or suffixes.
