The customer telephone support center of the computer sales company JAG needs to determine the minimum number of operators required to handle customer support. Each customer has a specific time required for support, maximum waiting time before hanging up, and a time interval before they can call back. All customers call at the same time, and the simulation is successful if all calls are answered within a given time limit. You need to calculate the minimum number of operators needed to ensure that all customers are supported within the given time frame.
