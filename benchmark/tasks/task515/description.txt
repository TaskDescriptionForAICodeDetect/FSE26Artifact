AOR wants to create a strong password consisting only of lowercase English letters. Given N examples of dangerous passwords from friends, AOR decided to create a password that satisfies the following conditions: it must have a length of at least 1 character, be different from any contiguous substring of any dangerous password, be the shortest string that meets the first two conditions, and be the lexicographically smallest string among all strings that meet these three conditions. Write a program to generate such a strong password for AOR.
