Satake dislikes anything that is curved, including actions like turning left or right. Living on the XY plane, Satake has been asked to shop at N stores located at coordinates (X_1,Y_1), (X_2,Y_2), ..., (X_N,Y_N). Starting from home at (0, 0) and facing the direction (1, 0), he can perform the following actions any number of times: move forward in the direction he is facing, rotate clockwise or counterclockwise by any angle while at the same coordinates as a store or home, and shop while maintaining his position and direction at the stores. The task is to find the minimum total angle of rotation Satake needs to make to visit all stores and return home, given that he dislikes turning. For example, if he rotates 90 degrees clockwise and then 90 degrees counterclockwise, the total angle of rotation is 180 degrees.
