Snuke built a zoo with N animals arranged in a circle, where each animal is either an honest sheep that speaks the truth or a lying wolf that tells lies. Each animal was asked if their neighboring animals are of the same species, answering with 'o' (same species) or 'x' (different species). The goal is to determine if there is a consistent way to assign the species to the animals based on their responses. If such an assignment exists, output one valid assignment; otherwise, print -1.
