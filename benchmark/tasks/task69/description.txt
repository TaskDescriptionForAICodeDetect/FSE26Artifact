Create a program that converts a given string into a specific code based on predefined character codes. Each character in the input string must be replaced with its corresponding code from the provided tables, then concatenated and split into groups of five characters. Lastly, map these groups back into characters using a second table. The program must handle multiple datasets, each consisting of a single line string containing characters defined in the tables.
