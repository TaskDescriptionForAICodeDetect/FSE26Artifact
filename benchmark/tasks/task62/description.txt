You are given a flat surface consisting of an 8x8 grid. One of the shapes labeled A to G is placed on this grid. Each shape is represented by filled squares (1) and empty squares (0). Your task is to write a program that reads the grid representation and outputs the type of the shape (A to G) that is placed on it. There will always be exactly one shape on the grid, and it will be one of A to G. The input consists of multiple datasets, each representing a grid as 8 strings of 8 characters (1s and 0s). Datasets are separated by a blank line. The number of datasets will not exceed 50.
