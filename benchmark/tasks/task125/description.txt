Yuki created a board game called 'surrounding sugoroku' for children to play at an event. In this board game, there are squares arranged in a circle, each labeled with a positive integer. Players start by choosing a square as their starting point and move their piece clockwise according to the number written on it. They continue moving clockwise by the number on the square they land on. The game ends when they land back on their starting square, which is called 'agari'. However, depending on the starting square chosen, it is possible that players may never reach 'agari'. Yuki wants to count how many starting squares can lead to 'agari'. Write a program that takes the information about the squares and reports the number of squares that can lead to 'agari'.
