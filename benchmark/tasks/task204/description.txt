Create a program that formats and prints input text as a multi-column list based on specified parameters. The program should take four parameters: (1) the number of lines per column, (2) the number of columns per page, (3) the width of each column, and (4) the width of the spacing between columns. Input consists of one or more data sets, each starting with four integers followed by lines of text. The program must handle wrapping of long lines, filling of empty spaces with dots, and include specific delimiters at the end of pages and data sets.
