There is a grid of squares with H+1 horizontal rows and W vertical columns. You will start at one of the squares in the top row and repeat moving one square right or down. However, for each integer i from 1 through H, you cannot move down from the A_i-th, (A_i + 1)-th, ..., B_i-th squares from the left in the i-th row from the top. For each integer k from 1 through H, find the minimum number of moves needed to reach one of the squares in the (k+1)-th row from the top. (The starting square can be chosen individually for each case.) If, starting from any square in the top row, none of the squares in the (k+1)-th row can be reached, print -1 instead.
