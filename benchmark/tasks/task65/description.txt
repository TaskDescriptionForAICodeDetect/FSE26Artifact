There is a grid map of dimensions 12 rows by 12 columns that represents terrain. Each cell is either white or black; white represents the sea, and black represents land. Two adjacent black cells (either vertically or horizontally) are considered connected. A single black cell or a region of connected black cells is referred to as an 'island'. You are required to write a program that reads the map data and outputs the number of islands for each dataset.
