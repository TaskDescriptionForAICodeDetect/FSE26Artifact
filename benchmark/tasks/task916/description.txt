Let N be a positive integer. There is a numerical sequence of length 3N, a = (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{3N}). Snuke is constructing a new sequence of length 2N, a', by removing exactly N elements from a without changing the order of the remaining elements. The score of a' is defined as the sum of the elements in the first half of a' minus the sum of the elements in the second half of a'. Find the maximum possible score of a'.
