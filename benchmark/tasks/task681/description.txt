There is a game that involves three variables, denoted A, B, and C. As the game progresses, there will be N events where you are asked to make a choice. Each choice is represented by a string s_i. If s_i is AB, you must add 1 to A or B then subtract 1 from the other; if s_i is AC, you must add 1 to A or C then subtract 1 from the other; if s_i is BC, you must add 1 to B or C then subtract 1 from the other. After each choice, none of A, B, and C should be negative. Determine whether it is possible to make N choices under this condition. If it is possible, also give one such way to make the choices.
