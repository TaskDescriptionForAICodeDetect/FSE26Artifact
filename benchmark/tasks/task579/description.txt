Write a program that reads an integer n and draws a Koch curve based on recursive calls of depth n. The Koch curve is a well-known type of fractal. You can draw a Koch curve using the following algorithm: Divide a given segment (p1, p2) into three equal segments. Replace the middle segment with the two sides of an equilateral triangle (s, u, t) of the same length as the segment. Repeat this procedure recursively for the new segments (p1, s), (s, u), (u, t), (t, p2). You should start with the segment (0, 0) to (100, 0).
