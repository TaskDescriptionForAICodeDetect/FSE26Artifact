Your task is to write a program that simulates key operations in an Emacs-like text editor. The program should read a text consisting of several lines and apply a series of commands to edit the text accordingly. The cursor starts at the beginning of the first line and the buffer is initially empty. The commands allow the user to move the cursor, cut, paste, and delete characters in the text.
