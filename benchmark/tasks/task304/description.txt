G, a university student living in a sky city, has trained his caterpillar, Imotarou, to eat all the food in order with the shortest number of steps. Your task is to determine whether Imotarou can indeed eat the food in the specified order by writing a program. There are multiple obstacles and food items located in a grid area. The caterpillar has a head and five body segments and explores this area to find the minimum number of steps taken to eat all the food in the correct order. If it is impossible to eat all the food, output -1. The caterpillar's head overlaps with the food when it eats it. The area consists of the following characters: empty cell -> '.', obstacle -> '#', food -> '1', '2', ..., '9', initial caterpillar position -> head 'S', body 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'. The caterpillar must maintain a consistent structure while moving. The caterpillar cannot move into its own body, obstacles, or out of bounds, but it can move over food without eating it. The movement locations are specifically defined.
