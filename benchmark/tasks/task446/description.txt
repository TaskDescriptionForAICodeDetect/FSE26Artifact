In the International City of Pipe Construction, you need to write a program to minimize the length of water pipes needed to stop water supply to a specific repairing point while repairing the water pipe network. The network consists of water pipe segments, stop valves, and a single source point. Given the coordinates of the pipe segments, stop valves, source point, and repairing point, your task is to determine the minimal length of pipe to be stopped. If it's impossible to stop water supply to the repairing point, return -1.
