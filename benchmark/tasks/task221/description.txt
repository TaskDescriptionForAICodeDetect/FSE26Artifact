You are given a marine area map represented as a grid of squares, where each square is either land (1) or sea (0). Your task is to write a program that reads the map and counts the number of distinct islands. An island consists of land squares that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent to each other. The input consists of multiple datasets, each defined by the width and height of the map followed by the grid itself. The input ends when '0 0' is encountered. Output the number of islands for each dataset on a new line.
