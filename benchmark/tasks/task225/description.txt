Dr. Fukuoka has invented square-shaped panels that can be fused together if they are of the same color. Each panel can be changed in color up to five times via electrical shocks. The goal is to determine the maximum number of united panels that can be formed in a specified target color after these color changes, starting from a randomly colored rectangular arrangement of panels. You are to write a program to find the largest possible unified panel size with the target color after performing the allowed color changes.
