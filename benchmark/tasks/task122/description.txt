You are managing a cybercafe and you are trying to solve a problem that has been pointed out by customers. The problem is that the volumes of a series of books are not arranged in order on the shelves, making it difficult to find the desired volume. The book series with the highest number of volumes is 'Detective AkaBeko' (commonly known as 'AkaBeko'). Due to its length, a special shelf has been prepared for 'AkaBeko'. The weight and thickness of each volume vary, and the width and weight limits for each shelf also vary. You need to arrange the books on the shelf fulfilling the following conditions: 1) Arrange from volume 1 to a certain volume of 'AkaBeko' in order, without any missing volumes. 2) The total weight of the books on each shelf should not exceed the defined weight limit. 3) The total thickness of the books on each shelf should not exceed the defined width. The task is to create a program to find the maximum number of 'AkaBeko' volumes that can be arranged on the shelf, satisfying these conditions.
