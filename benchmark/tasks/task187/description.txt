In a Christmas-themed problem, Santa Claus delivers presents using a sleigh pulled by a reindeer through a city modeled as an undirected weighted graph. The delivery must be completed before dawn, following the shortest path from a Christmas tree (node 0) to the opposite end of the city (node n-1). Each of p children can see Santa if he passes their respective nodes on the graph. The task is to calculate the probability of each child seeing Santa, accounting for multiple possible shortest paths.
