An artist named Shinagawa has been commissioned to present n pieces of artwork, each represented by a cube with its six faces painted in one of six colors: Red, Yellow, Blue, Magenta, Green, and Cyan. While reviewing the pieces prior to the exhibition, you noticed that some cubes may seem to have different colorings, but actually consist of the same combination of colors. Therefore, you need to write a program that takes the number of created artworks and their color configurations, and outputs how many more distinct pieces are required for the exhibition.
