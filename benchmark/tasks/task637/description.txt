There are N points on a number line, where the i-th point is located at coordinate X_i. These points are ordered such that for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ N-1), X_i < X_{i+1} is true. An integer K is given along with Q queries. Each query consists of two integers L_i and R_i, and a set s of points is defined as a good set if it satisfies the following conditions: Each point in s is one of X_{L_i}, X_{L_i+1}, ..., X_{R_i}. The distance between any two distinct points in s is greater than or equal to K. The size of s is maximized based on these conditions. For each query, the task is to find the size of the union of all good sets.
