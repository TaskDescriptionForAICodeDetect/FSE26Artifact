You are given an H x W grid. The square at the top-left corner is represented by (0, 0), and the square at the bottom-right corner is represented by (H-1, W-1). N squares are painted black at positions (x_1, y_1), (x_2, y_2), ..., (x_N, y_N), while the remaining squares are painted white. Calculate the shortest distance between all pairs of white squares, and find the sum of these distances, modulo 1,000,000,007.
