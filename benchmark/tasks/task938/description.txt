AtCoDeer the deer found N rectangles lying on the table, each with a height of 1. If we consider the surface of the desk as a two-dimensional plane, the i-th rectangle (1≤i≤N) covers the vertical range of [i-1,i] and the horizontal range of [l_i,r_i]. AtCoDeer will move these rectangles horizontally so that all the rectangles are connected. For each rectangle, the cost to move it horizontally by a distance of x is x. Find the minimum cost to achieve connectivity. It is guaranteed that the cost will always be an integer under the problem's constraints.
