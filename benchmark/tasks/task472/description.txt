Ikuta-kun, brave and daring, has finally cornered the infamous Count Big Bridge! Now, Count Big Bridge is trapped in a rectangular room with a width of w meters and a depth of h meters, awaiting his end. Choose a corner of the room and establish a coordinate system where the width direction is the x-axis and the depth direction is the y-axis, with the inside of the room being in the positive direction. Count Big Bridge is located at point (p, q), and at point (x, y), there is Ikuta-kun's ultimate weapon, a shockwave launcher, which emits shockwaves in all directions at a speed of v meters per second. These shockwaves are effective for t seconds and reflect off the walls of the room. Ikuta-kun, who is outside the room, wants to know how many times the shockwaves hit Count Big Bridge. If shockwaves hit the enemy from n directions simultaneously, it counts as n hits, and if a shockwave hits the enemy exactly t seconds later, that is also valid. The shockwaves are not extinguished by obstacles like the launcher itself or Count Big Bridge and do not interfere with each other. Write a program that calculates the number of times the shockwave hits Count Big Bridge.
