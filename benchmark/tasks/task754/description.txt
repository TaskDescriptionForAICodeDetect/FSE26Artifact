There is a tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. Each edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i, with colors and lengths c_i and d_i respectively. Each edge's color is represented by an integer between 1 and N-1. You need to answer Q queries. For each query j, you will change the length of every edge of color x_j to y_j and then find the distance between Vertex u_j and Vertex v_j. The changes of edge lengths do not affect subsequent queries.
