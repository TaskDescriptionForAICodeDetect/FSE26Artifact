In concurrent processing environments, a deadlock is a situation where two or more threads are mutually waiting for each other to release resources and cannot proceed. Your task is to detect whether there is any possibility of deadlocks when multiple threads try to execute a given instruction sequence concurrently. The instruction sequence consists of characters 'u' or digits from '0' to '9', where each digit represents a lock that a thread is trying to acquire. There are 10 locks available (L0 to L9) and a thread can acquire a lock unless it is already held by another thread. Once a thread acquires a lock, it holds it until it executes the instruction 'u' to release it. You need to determine whether the given instruction sequence can lead to a deadlock situation or not. If it can, print "UNSAFE"; otherwise, print "SAFE".
