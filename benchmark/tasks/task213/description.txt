The problem involves determining the order of street names at crossings in the city of Kyoto, where streets only cross at orthogonal intersections. Given a list of known crossings and a series of queries, you need to establish if the queried crossings are valid based on the strength of the streets involved. A street is considered stronger than another if there is a sequence of crossings or equal strength relationships leading from one street to the other.
