Joisino is planning a tour in Takahashi Town, which is divided into square sections. She wants to count the number of different 'good' touring plans based on specific starting, lunch, and ending sections. The conditions for these sections are defined by given coordinate ranges, and she must travel from the start to the end section via the lunch section while minimizing the distance. The result must be calculated modulo 10^9 + 7.
