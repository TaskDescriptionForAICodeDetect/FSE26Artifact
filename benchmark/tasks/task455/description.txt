A magician lives in a country consisting of N islands and M bridges. Some bridges are magical, which can have their lengths changed to the same non-negative integer by the magician. There is a 2-player race game starting from islands S_1 and S_2 to reach island T. The goal is to minimize the difference between the shortest path distances from S_1 to T and S_2 to T by adjusting the lengths of the magical bridges before the race starts. Your task is to calculate how small this gap can be.
