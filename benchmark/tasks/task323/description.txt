You are an astronaut who discovers a mysterious planet with colorful gems scattered all over it. Due to toxic air on the planet, you cannot touch it directly, so you must use a robot to collect the gems. The robot operates on a 2D plane inside a square area from (0, 0) to (20, 20) and starts from the center (10, 10). You are required to develop a program that determines whether the robot can collect all the gems after executing a series of movement commands.
