You need to create a program that determines whether non-rectangular items (which may be weapons) are definitely present in a piece of baggage based on image analysis results. The analysis results consist of grids where certain materials are represented by uppercase letters (A-Z) and empty areas are represented by dots (.). If it is certain that there is non-rectangular material in the baggage, output 'SUSPICIOUS'. If there is no evidence of non-rectangular materials, output 'SAFE'.
