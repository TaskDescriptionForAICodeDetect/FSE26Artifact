You are given an integer N. Determine if there exists a tree with 2N vertices numbered 1 to 2N satisfying the following condition, and show one such tree if the answer is yes. Assume that, for each integer i between 1 and N (inclusive), Vertex i and N+i have the weight i. Then, for each integer i between 1 and N, the bitwise XOR of the weights of the vertices on the path between Vertex i and N+i (including themselves) is i.
