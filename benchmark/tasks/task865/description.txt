There are N people standing on the x-axis, with each person's coordinate being an integer between 0 and 10^9. You are given M pieces of information about their positions in the form (L_i, R_i, D_i), which indicates that Person R_i is to the right of Person L_i by D_i units. Some of this information may be incorrect. Your task is to determine if there is a consistent set of values (x_1, x_2, ..., x_N) that satisfies all the given pieces of information.
