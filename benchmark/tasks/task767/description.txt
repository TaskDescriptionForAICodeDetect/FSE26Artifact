There is an infinitely large pond, represented as a number line, with N lotuses at coordinates 0, 1, 2, ..., N-1, where each lotus has an integer value s_i written on it. You start at coordinate 0 and aim to maximize your score through a game that allows you to choose positive integers A and B for movements. You move from your current coordinate x to y = x + A or y = x - B. If you land on a coordinate with a lotus, your score increases by the lotus's value; if you land on an empty coordinate, you drown, and your score decreases drastically. The goal is to determine the highest score achievable with the optimal A and B choices.
