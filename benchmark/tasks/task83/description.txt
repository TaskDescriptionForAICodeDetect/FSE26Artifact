Create a program that determines the positional relationship between a triangle and a circle on a plane. Both shapes include their boundaries. The triangle is defined by the positions of its three vertices, and the circle is defined by its center position and radius. The positions are given as pairs of integers in a Cartesian coordinate system, with the radius also given as an integer.
