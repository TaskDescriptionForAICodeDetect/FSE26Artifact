In the Industrial Convex Pillar City (ICPC), which consists of several buildings shaped like convex polygons, you need to walk from your current location S to your destination T while avoiding the sunniest areas as much as possible. You will not receive sunlight if you are standing in the shadow cast by a building that is lined up in a straight line with the sun. Additionally, walking along the outer perimeter of the buildings provides shade, meaning you will not receive sunlight during that time. You can walk freely anywhere in the city except for the inside of the buildings. Your task is to create a program that outputs the shortest distance you walk in the sunlight when going from your current location to your destination.
