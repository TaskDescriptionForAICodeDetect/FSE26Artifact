Jack loves to watch Japanese anime programs, but he cannot watch programs that are broadcasted at the same time. Your task is to write a program that reads a timetable of anime programs and determines the maximum number of programs Jack can watch while ensuring he watches all his favorite programs. If any of his favorite programs air at the same time, you should output -1. Each program has a duration of 30 minutes. The input consists of multiple datasets describing different seasons with various programs and Jack's favorites.
