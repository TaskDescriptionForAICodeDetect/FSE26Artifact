In a social networking service (SNS) with N users, determine how many friend candidates each user has. A user a is a friend candidate for user b if: (1) a is not equal to b, (2) there is no friendship between a and b, (3) there is no blockship between a and b, and (4) there exists a sequence of users from a to b connected by friendships. You are given the number of friendships (M) and blockships (K) between users.
