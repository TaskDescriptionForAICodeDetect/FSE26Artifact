You are given two integers A and B. Print a grid where each square is painted white or black that satisfies the following conditions: Let the size of the grid be h x w (h vertical, w horizontal). Both h and w are at most 100. The set of squares painted white is divided into exactly A connected components. The set of squares painted black is divided into exactly B connected components. It is guaranteed that there always exists one or more solutions under the specified conditions. If there are multiple solutions, any of them may be printed.
