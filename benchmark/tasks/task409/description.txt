A robot is in a two-dimensional maze that has an entrance and an exit. The maze consists of H by W grid cells, where each cell is either empty or a wall. One empty cell is connected to the entrance and another to the exit. The robot can only move forward or turn left or right according to a series of commands. The objective is to determine whether the robot can reach the exit cell from the entrance cell using the commands given.
