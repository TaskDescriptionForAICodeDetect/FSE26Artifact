You need to write a program to calculate the minimum number of faces that need to be repainted for a given set of colored cubes to become identically colored. Each cube has six faces that can be painted in different colors, and two cubes are considered identically colored if they can be made to look the same through rotation. The input consists of multiple datasets, each describing a set of cubes with their face colors. Your program should output the minimum number of face repaints for each dataset.
