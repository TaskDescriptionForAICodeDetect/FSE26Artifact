N brothers are discussing the inheritance of their parent's estate. The estate includes a vast piece of land shaped like a rectangle, stretching H km north-south and W km east-west. The land is managed in units of 1 kmÂ². The brothers must inherit sections of the land, ensuring that each brother's chosen sections form a single rectangle and do not overlap with others. It is allowed for sections of land to remain unclaimed. The task is to create a program that finds a way to divide the land so that the brother with the lowest inheritance value has the maximum possible value.
