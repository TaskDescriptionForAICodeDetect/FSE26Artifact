You need to create a program that determines whether a journey between two specified stations can be made given a train ticket that allows travel from a boarding station to a destination station with the possibility of intermediate stops. In a given railroad network, there are multiple stations and direct connections between them. The program should analyze the provided tickets and determine if a journey can be made based on specific conditions relating to the shortest route and intermediate stops.
