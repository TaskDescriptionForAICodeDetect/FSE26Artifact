In an infinitely large triangular grid, there are lamps at each point with integer coordinates. Initially, only the lamp at (X, Y) is on. Snuke performs operations by choosing two integers x and y to toggle the lamps at (x, y), (x, y+1), and (x+1, y). After a series of operations, N lamps identified by their coordinates are on. Your task is to determine the original coordinates X and Y of the lamp that was initially on.
