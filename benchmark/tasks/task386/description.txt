Create a program that determines whether a given program written in the Defunge programming language will halt. The Defunge program consists of commands represented by single characters arranged in a two-dimensional grid. The program starts executing from the top-left corner and can change its direction according to the commands. If the execution reaches the '@' command, it stops. If the program might stop, output 'YES'; otherwise, output 'NO'.
