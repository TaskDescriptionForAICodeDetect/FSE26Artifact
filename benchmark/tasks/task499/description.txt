Generate a new password from an old password according to specific rules. The new password should have the same number of digits as the old one, with each digit appearing at most once. The new password should maximize the difference from the old password, defined as min(|a - b|, 10^N - |a - b|). If there are multiple candidates with the same maximum difference, select the smallest integer value.
