The problem is to find the length of the longest path and to form the corresponding list of stations on the path for each railway system represented as a graph. Each graph consists of stations (vertices) and direct routes (edges) with given distances. The longest path can start from any station and travel without repeating direct routes, with multiple paths possible. The task is to report the lexicographically least path length and corresponding station list.
