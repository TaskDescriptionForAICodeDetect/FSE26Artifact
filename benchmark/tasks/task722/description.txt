There is a cave consisting of N rooms and M one-directional passages. The rooms are numbered 1 through N. Takahashi starts in Room 1, and Room N is the exit. Each passage connects Room s_i and Room t_i (s_i < t_i) and can only be traversed in the direction from Room s_i to Room t_i. For each room except Room N, there is at least one passage going from that room. Each time Takahashi reaches a room, he chooses a passage uniformly at random from the available ones and takes that passage. Aoki can block one passage (or do nothing) before Takahashi leaves Room 1 to minimize the expected number of passages Takahashi takes before reaching Room N. Find the value of E, the expected number of passages, considering Aoki's choice.
