You are required to crack an encrypted equation over binary numbers. The original equation consists solely of binary digits ("0" and "1"), operator symbols ("+", "-", and "*"), parentheses ("(" and ")"), and an equal sign ("="). The encryption replaces some occurrences of characters in the original arithmetic equation with letters. Each occurrence of one character is replaced, if at all, with the same letter. Occurrences of two different characters are never replaced by the same letter. An equation is considered correct if it adheres to the given grammar and the computed values of both sides are equal. You need to write a program that counts the number of distinct valid original equations for a given encrypted equation.
