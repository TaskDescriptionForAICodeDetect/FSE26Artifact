You are responsible for managing a dam that can hold up to L liters of water, starting from an empty state. Every morning, a specified amount of water with a certain temperature flows into the dam. Each night, you can discharge some water while ensuring that the dam does not overflow the following morning. Your task is to determine the maximum possible temperature of water in the dam at noon for each day, ensuring there are exactly L liters of water in the dam. The mixing of water will follow the rule that the new temperature is determined by the weighted sum based on the volumes and temperatures. The discharge amount for each day can be adjusted independently. The output is the maximum temperature for the state of the dam at noon each day, and results must have a precision of at most 10^-6.
