To perform well in ICPC, practice is essential. A rabbit wants to win in ICPC, so it decided to practice today by improving its creativity through drawing. The task involves drawing patterns using rectangular stamps on a 4x4 grid of paper in specified colors: red, green, and blue. The stamps are rectangular and must fit perfectly within the grid cells without rotating them. The paper starts with no color. When a stamp is pressed onto the paper, the area covered changes to the stamp's color, hiding any underlying color. The color chosen for a stamp is based on the ink used, allowing the selection of any color for any stamp. It is possible to press a stamp partially off the grid, and the excess will be ignored. A single stamp can be used multiple times and can be applied in different colors. As pressing stamps requires some nerve, the goal is to minimize the number of times stamps are pressed.
