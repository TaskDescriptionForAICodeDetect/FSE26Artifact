We have a rooted binary tree with N vertices, where the vertices are numbered 1 to N. Vertex 1 is the root, and the parent of Vertex i (i â‰¥ 2) is Vertex [i/2]. Each vertex contains an item with a value V_i and a weight W_i. You need to process Q queries where for each query given a vertex v and a positive integer L, you should select items in v and the ancestors of v such that their total weight is at most L and find the maximum total value of the selected items.
