In a game, there are N characters arranged in a column, where each character can be red, blue, or yellow. Initially, there are no four or more characters of the same color consecutively. A player can change the color of a character at a chosen position. If this results in four or more characters of the same color being consecutive, those characters disappear. This may cause a chain reaction, leading to more characters disappearing until there are no four or more consecutive characters of the same color. The goal of the game is to minimize the number of characters that remain. Given the initial configuration of the N characters' colors, you need to write a program that finds the minimum number of characters that will remain after changing one character's color.
