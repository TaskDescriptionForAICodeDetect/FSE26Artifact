There is a tree with n nodes and n-1 edges. There are military bases on t out of the n nodes. The goal is to disconnect the bases as much as possible by destroying k edges. The tree will be divided into k+1 regions when k edges are destroyed, ensuring that each region contains at least one base. There is a cost associated with destroying each edge. Find the minimum cost to achieve this disconnection.
