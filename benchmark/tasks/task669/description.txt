Snuke has a string x of length N. Initially, every character in x is 0. Snuke can do the following two operations any number of times in any order: Choose A consecutive characters in x and replace each of them with 0. Choose B consecutive characters in x and replace each of them with 1. Find the number of different strings that x can be after Snuke finishes doing operations. This count can be enormous, so compute it modulo (10^9+7).
