In this problem, you need to navigate through a maze represented as a W x H grid. You start at cell (1, 1) and your goal is to reach cell (W, H) by moving only to the right or down. The maze contains free cells (denoted by '.') and obstacles (denoted by '#'). There are also jewels (lowercase letters) in some cells, and holes (uppercase letters) for these jewels in other cells. You can pick up jewels and place them into the corresponding holes, but you can only retrieve the jewels in a last-in-first-out manner due to your bag being a stack. Your task is to determine the maximum number of jewels you can place in the holes along your path from (1, 1) to (W, H). If it's impossible to reach the end cell, you should return -1.
