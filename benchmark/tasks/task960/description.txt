There are N cities in a two-dimensional plane, each with a certain amount of water. Snuke can carry any amount of water between cities, but some water leaks out during the transfer, depending on the distance between the cities. The goal is to determine the maximum minimum amount of water that can be distributed to each city after an arbitrary number of water-carrying operations to maximize the minimum water available in all cities.
