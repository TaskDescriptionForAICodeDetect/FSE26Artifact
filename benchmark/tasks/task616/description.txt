Write a program that manipulates a sequence A = {a_0, a_1, ..., a_{n-1}} using the following operations: update(s, t, x) to change a_s, a_{s+1}, ..., a_t to x, and getSum(s, t) to print the sum of a_s, a_{s+1}, ..., a_t. The initial values of a_i (i = 0, 1, ..., n-1) are 0. Input comprises n (the number of elements in A) and q (the number of queries). Each query can either be '0 s t x' for an update or '1 s t' for a sum calculation. Output the sum for each getSum query on a new line.
