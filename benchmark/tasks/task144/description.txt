You are tasked with determining the minimum sum of authentication levels needed for visitors to access at least R rooms in two offices of the Just Odd Inventions (JOI) company. Each office consists of rooms in a grid layout, with certain security levels associated with each room. Visitors can only enter a room if their authentication level meets or exceeds the room's security level. Given the dimensions of the offices, the location of the elevator hall, and the security levels of the rooms, write a program to solve the problem.
