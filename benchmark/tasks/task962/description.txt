Snuke received two matrices A and B as birthday presents. Each matrix is an N by N matrix consisting only of 0s and 1s. He computed the product of the two matrices, C = AB, performing all computations modulo two. Now Snuke only knows the matrix C, which also consists of only 0s and 1s. Your task is to compute the number of possible ordered pairs of the two matrices A and B, modulo 10^9+7.
