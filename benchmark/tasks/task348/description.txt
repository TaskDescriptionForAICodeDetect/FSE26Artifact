You need to determine if a given set of points can form a line-symmetric polygon. Each dataset consists of a number of points, and you should check whether these points satisfy the conditions for being the vertices of a line-symmetric polygon. The edges of the polygon must not cross or touch except at the endpoints of adjacent edges. The input ends with a line containing a single zero, which should not be processed.
