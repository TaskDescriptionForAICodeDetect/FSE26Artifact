We have a tree with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. The i-th edge in the tree connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i, and its length is w_i. Your objective is to paint each vertex in the tree either white or black such that for any two vertices painted the same color, the distance between them is an even number. Find a coloring of the vertices that meets this condition and print it. It can be assured that at least one valid coloring exists.
