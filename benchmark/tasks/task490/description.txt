The Wall Making Game is a two-player board game played on a H x W board. Each cell in the board is empty, marked, or wall. At the beginning of the game, there are no walls. Players take turns choosing empty cells. When a player picks a cell, they turn that cell and all adjacent cells (in all four directions) into walls until they hit a wall or the edge of the board. Marked cells cannot be chosen but can be converted to walls. The task is to write a program that determines which player wins the game if both play optimally from the given initial board configuration.
