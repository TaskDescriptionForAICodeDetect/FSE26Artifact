In a social media platform called Ikatter, tweets can receive replies. A tweet is displayed on the screen under one of the following conditions: 1. It has not replied to any tweet. 2. It has not received any replies. 3. If it comes from a tweet that meets condition 2, it can be traced back within K replies. Given N tweets, where A_i = 0 for a tweet that does not reply and A_i > 0 for a tweet that replies to A_i-th tweet, calculate the number of tweets that will be displayed on the screen.
