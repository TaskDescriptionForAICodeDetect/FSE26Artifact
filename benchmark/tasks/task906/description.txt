This is an interactive task. Snuke has a favorite positive integer, N. You can ask him the following type of question at most 64 times: 'Is n your favorite integer?' Identify N. Snuke answers 'Yes' if both n ≤ N and str(n) ≤ str(N) hold true, or if both n > N and str(n) > str(N) hold true. Otherwise, he answers 'No'. Here, str(x) is the decimal representation of x as a string. Strings are compared lexicographically. The constraints are 1 ≤ N ≤ 10^9.
