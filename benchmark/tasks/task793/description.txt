Snuke is walking along a number line with L ears. He starts and ends at integer coordinates and can only change direction at integer coordinates. Each time he passes a point with coordinate i-0.5, he places a stone in his i-th ear. After Snuke finishes walking, Ringo needs to perform operations to ensure each ear contains a specified number of stones. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations Ringo needs to make these adjustments when he can freely decide how Snuke walks.
