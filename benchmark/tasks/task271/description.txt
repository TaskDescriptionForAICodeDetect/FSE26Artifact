You need to write a program that evaluates ASCII expressions, which are mathematical expressions represented in multiple lines, using typewriter-style formatting. The input consists of several datasets, each representing an ASCII expression with constraints on its structure. Your program should compute the value of each ASCII expression modulo 2011 and output the results. The evaluation follows specific rules for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and handling exponents and fractions.
