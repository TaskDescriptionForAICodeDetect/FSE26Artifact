You are in an office represented as an R x C grid consisting of walls and rooms. There is exactly one route between any two rooms. You take 1 unit of time to move to the next room, and you need to switch on a light upon entering a room. You can choose to leave the light on or turn it off when leaving. However, the light consumes electricity while on. Given a list of tasks represented by room coordinates, you need to complete them in a specified order while minimizing electricity consumption, taking into account the costs associated with the duration the lights are on and the costs to switch the lights on and off. After completing all tasks, ensure that no light is left on in any room.
