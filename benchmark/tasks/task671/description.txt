Snuke has X + Y balls, X of which have an integer A written on them and Y have an integer B written on them. He will divide these balls into groups where each group must contain at least one ball. A group is considered good if the sum of the integers in that group is a multiple of an integer C. Your task is to determine the maximum possible number of good groups that can be formed. You need to solve this for T test cases.
