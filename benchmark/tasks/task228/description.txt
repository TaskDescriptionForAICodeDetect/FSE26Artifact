You are to write a program that prints the minimum number of cards needed to pass through a rectangular maze, considering that one door may be broken. The maze is represented by a grid of rooms with walls, some of which have doors that can be opened using a card. If a door is broken, the inserted card will return, and you cannot tell a broken door from a working door just by its appearance. If you cannot find a way through the maze when a door is broken, you need to output -1.
