We have a square grid with N rows and M columns. Takahashi will write an integer in each square according to the following rules: First, write 0 in every square. For each row i (from 1 to N), choose an integer k_i (0 <= k_i <= M) and add 1 to each of the leftmost k_i squares in the i-th row. For each column j (from 1 to M), choose an integer l_j (0 <= l_j <= N) and add 1 to each of the topmost l_j squares in the j-th column. We need to find the number of different grids that can be created in this way, modulo 998244353. Two grids are considered different if there exists at least one square with a different integer.
