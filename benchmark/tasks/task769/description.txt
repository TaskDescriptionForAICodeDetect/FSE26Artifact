There is a function f(x), which starts as a constant function f(x) = 0. You will process Q queries, which can be of two types: update queries and evaluation queries. An update query '1 a b' updates the function to g(x) = f(x) + |x - a| + b. An evaluation query '2' requires you to print the x that minimizes f(x) and the minimum value of f(x). In case of multiple minimizing x values, choose the smallest one. All input values are integers, with the number of queries Q ranging from 1 to 200000 and integers a and b in the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The first query will always be an update query.
