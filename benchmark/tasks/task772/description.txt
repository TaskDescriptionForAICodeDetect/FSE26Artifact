The beauty of a sequence a of length n is defined as the bitwise exclusive or (XOR) of all its elements. You are given a sequence A of length N. Snuke will insert zero or more partitions in A to divide it into several non-empty contiguous subsequences. There are 2^(N-1) possible ways to insert partitions. Your task is to count how many of these ways divide A into sequences whose beauties are all equal, and return this count modulo 10^9 + 7.
