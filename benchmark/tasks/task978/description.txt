Mr. Takahashi has a memory of a permutation of integers from 1 to N, where some elements are forgotten. He wants to find the sum of the page numbers of all possible permutations matching his memory in lexicographical order from a dictionary that contains all N! permutations. If an element is forgotten, it is represented by 0. Compute the sum of the page numbers he has to check, modulo 10^9 + 7.
