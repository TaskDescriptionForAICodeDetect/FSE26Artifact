Write a program which performs operations on a binary search tree (BST) by adding the find operation. The operations include: inserting a key into the BST, finding a key in the BST, and printing the keys of the BST in inorder and preorder traversal. The input consists of a number of operations followed by the operations themselves. The output should indicate the result of find operations and provide the traversal results for print operations.
