Consider car trips in a country with no friction, where cars have no engines and maintain constant speed after starting. Cars can adjust their speed by 1 at specific points called acceleration devices. The task is to write a program to determine the shortest time to travel from a starting city to a goal city via a network of cities and roads, respecting speed limits and acceleration rules. Input consists of multiple datasets describing cities, roads, the starting city, and the goal city. For each dataset, you should output the minimum travel time or 'unreachable' if the goal city cannot be reached.
