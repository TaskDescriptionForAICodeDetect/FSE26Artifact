Given a railway network involving multiple railway companies, where a fare table is provided, write a program to compute the path from a starting station to a goal station that incurs the least total fare. The fare may vary based on the distance and the railway company operating the line. The program should handle multiple datasets based on the specified input format and return the total fare for the best route, or -1 if the goal cannot be reached.
