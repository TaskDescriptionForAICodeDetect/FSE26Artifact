In JAG Kingdom, ICPC (Intentionally Compressible Programming Code) is a common programming language that uses only uppercase English letters. Programmers compress ICPC programs using Run Length Encoding (RLE). The task is to implement a replacement function where you have three strings A, B, and C encoded by RLE. You need to replace the first occurrence of the substring B in A with C and output the edited string encoded by RLE. If B does not occur in A, output A encoded by RLE without changes. Each string is formatted with pairs of letters and their respective lengths, ending with a dollar sign.
