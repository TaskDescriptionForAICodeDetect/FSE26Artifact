The Candy Witch CHARLOTTE is playing a cookie game with Mami Tomoe. The game is played on an 8x8 grid where cheese cookies and chocolate cookies are placed. Each cell can hold at most one cookie of either type. The Candy Witch places cheese cookies, while Mami Tomoe places chocolate cookies alternately. After placing a cookie, if there are opponent's cookies directly lined up between the newly placed cookie and existing cookies of the same type in any of the 8 possible directions (up, down, left, right, and the four diagonals), all the opponent's cookies in between are replaced by the newly placed cookie's type. Players can only place a cookie if they can replace at least one opponent's cookie; otherwise, they must pass their turn. Both players are not very strategic, so they will attempt to maximize the number of opponent cookies they can replace on their turn. Mami will prefer higher rows and, if tied, more left columns for her placements; whereas the Candy Witch will prefer lower rows and, if tied, more right columns. Given the initial state of the cookies on the tablecloth, determine the final state after both players have played until no further cookies can be placed.
