We have one slime. You can set the health of this slime to any integer value of your choice. A slime reproduces every second by spawning another slime that has strictly less health. You can freely choose the health of each new slime. The first reproduction of our slime will happen in one second. Determine if it is possible to set the healths of our first slime and the subsequent slimes spawned so that the multiset of the healths of the 2^N slimes that will exist in N seconds equals a multiset S, which contains 2^N integers.
