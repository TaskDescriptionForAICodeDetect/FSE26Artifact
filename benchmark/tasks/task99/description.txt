At Akabeko Elementary School, all students participate in a unique jogging exercise. Each student runs their own course at their own pace. After completing a lap, they return to the school. The goal is to determine when all students will meet again at the school after starting simultaneously. Given the number of students n, the distance d (in km) of each student's course lap, and their speed v (in km/h), create a program that outputs how many laps each student has completed when they next meet at the school. Each student will not run more than 231-1 laps.
