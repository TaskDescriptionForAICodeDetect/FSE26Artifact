There is a large old mansion where a cat lives. The mansion has a convex polygon shape when viewed from above and consists of several rooms enclosed by straight walls. Each wall is supported by pillars at both ends, and each wall has one hole that the cat can pass through. The cat can move between rooms and outside through these holes. The owner of the mansion calls the cat outside by whistling, and the cat, being clever, tries to escape using the fewest possible holes. However, the cat's location is unknown, and the time it takes to exit varies by day. The owner wants to determine the maximum number of holes the cat would need to pass through when making the 'best choice' to exit. You need to write a program that reads the mansion's layout and outputs the maximum number of holes the cat would traverse when taking the best route to the outside.
