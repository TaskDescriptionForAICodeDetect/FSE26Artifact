You are a member of the space station engineering team, tasked with designing a computer program to determine the shortest total length of corridors needed to connect multiple spherical cells of a space station. The cells may touch, overlap, or enclose each other, and they must be connected for crew members to walk between them. You need to compute the corridor lengths based on the positions and sizes of the cells given in the input format.
