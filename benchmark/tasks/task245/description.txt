Find the encryption key used in a simple bit-flipping scheme where the input is a sequence of 32-bit integers. The first nine integers in each dataset represent the encrypted data, and the ninth integer is a checksum which should equal the sum of the first eight integers modulo 2^32. The key needs to be derived based on the conditions regarding the least significant bit of these values.
