Karakuri Doll - Your task is to write a program that determines whether a doll can reach its master's location in a house and return to the kitchen. The doll can only execute two commands: 'turn left' and 'turn right'. The program should follow a defined path in the house, moving until it hits a wall and changing direction according to the commands provided. After reaching the master's position, the doll must return to the kitchen by executing the commands in reverse order with directions flipped. Evaluate whether the doll can reach the master and whether it can return to the kitchen based on a series of datasets representing different house layouts.
