We have an analog clock with three hands (the second hand, the minute hand and the hour hand) that rotate smoothly. You need to write a program to find the first time on or after a specified time where 'No two hands overlap each other' and 'The two angles between the second hand and the other two hands are equal'. The clock can be more than 12 hours, and the input will consist of multiple datasets with hours, minutes, and seconds given. Output the time in a specified format.
