We have an H x W grid where each square is painted either black or white. A character named Kenus starts at the top-left square (1, 1) and needs to reach the bottom-right square (H, W) by moving one square at a time (up, down, left, or right) while only stepping on white squares. Before starting the game, Snuke can change some white squares to black, but cannot change the colors of the starting or ending squares. The goal is to find the maximum number of color changes Snuke can make while still allowing Kenus to reach the destination. If it's impossible for Kenus to reach (H, W), -1 should be returned.
