This is an interactive task where you have 2N balls arranged in a row, numbered from 1 to 2N. There are N red balls and N blue balls among them, and N is an odd number. While blindfolded, you must guess the color of every ball correctly by asking at most 210 questions of the form: 'Are there more red balls than blue balls among these N chosen balls?' You need to receive the number N as input, ask questions to determine the colors of all balls, and print your final guess in a specific format.
