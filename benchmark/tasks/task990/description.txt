Alice, Bob, and Charlie are playing a card game where each player has a deck of cards containing letters 'a', 'b', or 'c'. The players take turns discarding the top card of their decks, and the player whose name starts with the discarded card takes the next turn. If a player discards their last card, they win the game. Given the number of cards for each player (N for Alice, M for Bob, K for Charlie), calculate how many initial deck configurations lead to Alice's victory, modulo 1,000,000,007.
