Takahashi found an undirected connected graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered from 1 to N. The i-th edge connects vertices a_i and b_i, and has a weight of c_i. He will play Q rounds of a game using this graph. In each round, two vertices S_i and T_i are specified. He needs to choose a subset of edges such that every vertex can be reached from at least one of the vertices S_i or T_i by traversing the chosen edges. For each round, find the minimum possible total weight of the edges chosen by Takahashi.
