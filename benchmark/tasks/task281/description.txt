Bob is an elementary schoolboy who is not very good at mathematics. He found his father's calculator and attempted to cheat on his homework involving calculations of given expressions that contain multiplications and additions. Unfortunately, the calculator evaluates expressions from left to right, ignoring operator precedence. Your task is to write a program that determines which calculation rule Bob's answer corresponds to, which can either be 'multiplication first' or 'left to right ignoring precedence'. An expression consists of single-digit integers (0-9) and the operators + and *. The input will include a mathematical expression and Bob's claimed answer, and the output should indicate if Bob's answer is the result of multiplication first, left to right, both, or if he made an error.
