There are N ants on a chessboard, each numbered from 1 to N. The chessboard has dimensions HÃ—W, and the northwest corner is white, with alternating white and black squares. Initially, each ant faces either east or south and occupies a distinct square on the chessboard. All ants move simultaneously, moving one square in the direction they are facing each unit time. If an ant moves outside the bounds of the chessboard, it falls off and disappears. When two ants occupy the same square, if the square is white, the ant facing east turns south, and the ant facing south turns east. If the square is black, both ants continue in their original direction. Create a program that reports the sequence in which ants fall off the board when given the size of the chessboard and the information about the ants. In case multiple ants fall off simultaneously, report the one with the smaller number first.
