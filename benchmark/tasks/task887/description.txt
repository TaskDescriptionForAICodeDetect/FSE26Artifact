We have a grid with H rows and W columns of squares. The square at the i-th row and j-th column is represented as (i, j). The distance between squares (i_1, j_1) and (i_2, j_2) is defined as |i_1 - i_2| + |j_1 - j_2|. Snuke wants to paint each square in red, yellow, green, or blue such that no two squares with an exact distance d have the same color. Find a way to paint the squares while satisfying this condition. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.
