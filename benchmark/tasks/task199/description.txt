You have full control over a robot that walks around in a rectangular field paved with square tiles like a chessboard. The robot is initially located at the center tile (1, 1) and can execute a series of movement commands such as FORWARD, BACKWARD, LEFT, RIGHT, and STOP. The goal is to determine the final coordinates of the robot after executing all commands in a command sequence, taking into account that the robot cannot move beyond the walls of the field. Input includes the size of the field followed by commands, and the output should reflect the final position of the robot for each command sequence.
