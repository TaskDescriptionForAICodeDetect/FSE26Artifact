You are the CEO of a company and need to determine the minimum salaries for N employees based on their contribution degrees. The salary of each employee must be a positive integer greater than zero, and if one employee has a higher contribution degree than another, they must receive a higher salary. The employees only know about their close colleagues, and certain conditions apply regarding complaints about salaries. You must calculate the minimum possible sum of all salaries while satisfying these conditions.
