Given a permutation P of length N and an integer K, determine whether it is possible to make the permutation P monotonically increasing by performing the following operation zero or more times: choose an integer x (0 ≤ x ≤ N-K) and perform a cyclic right shift on P[x+1] to P[x+K]. A cyclic right shift of a subsequence U means changing U = U_1, U_2, ..., U_M into U = U_M, U_1, ..., U_{M-1}.
