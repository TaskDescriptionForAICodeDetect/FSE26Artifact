You are a teacher at Iazu High School in the Zuia Kingdom. There are N cities and N-1 roads connecting them that allow you to move from one city to another via multiple roads. Each road allows bidirectional traffic and has a known length. For class activities, you have several themes applicable to three different cities. Each theme is assigned to a group of three students, with each student studying one of the three cities. After conducting their surveys, the students need to meet in one of the N cities to compile their results. The longest distance any student must travel to the meeting city determines the cost of the theme, and your goal is to find the meeting city that minimizes this cost. Given the number of cities, road information, and Q sets of three cities for each theme, write a program to determine the minimum cost for each theme.
