You are given a sequence D_1, D_2, ..., D_N of length N. The values of D_i are all distinct. Does a tree with N vertices that satisfies the following conditions exist? The vertices are numbered 1,2,..., N. The edges are numbered 1,2,..., N-1, and Edge i connects Vertex u_i and v_i. For each vertex i, the sum of the distances from i to the other vertices is D_i, assuming that the length of each edge is 1. If such a tree exists, construct one such tree.
