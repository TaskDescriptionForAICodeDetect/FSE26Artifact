You are given integers N, A, and B. Determine if there exists a permutation (P_0, P_1, ... P_{2^N-1}) of (0, 1, ... 2^N-1) that satisfies all of the following conditions, and create one such permutation if it exists: P_0 = A, P_{2^N-1} = B, and for all 0 â‰¤ i < 2^N-1, the binary representations of P_i and P_{i+1} differ by exactly one bit. If there is no such permutation, print 'NO'. If there is, print 'YES' in the first line and the permutation in the second line, separated by spaces.
