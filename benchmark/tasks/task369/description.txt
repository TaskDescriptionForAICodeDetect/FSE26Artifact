In the year 200X, a mysterious group called K at K University presented a new game called K Poker during the university's cultural festival. This game appears to be a regular poker game but enhances its complexity by introducing basic points for the cards. Each card's basic points are determined by its suit, and the total score of a hand is calculated by multiplying the sum of the basic points of the five cards in hand by the multiplier of the hand's ranking. Therefore, even if a strong hand like a full house is formed, it may be treated as weak if its basic points are zero, potentially losing to a one pair. The rules otherwise follow standard poker. You need to write a program to calculate the scores of poker hands based on these rules.
