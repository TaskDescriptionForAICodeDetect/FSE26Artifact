The convenience store 'Debun Eleven' is planning to open its first store in Wakamatsu City to expand its business. Since there are already many convenience stores in Wakamatsu City, the location of the new store will be key to its success. Debun Eleven has decided to operate in locations that are most likely to attract many customers based on the premise that 'customers tend to use the convenience store closest to their residence.' To understand the coverage of existing convenience stores, they have divided the map of Wakamatsu City into uniform hexagonal blocks (called 'blocks'). Each block can contain at most one existing convenience store. The distance to each convenience store is determined by the number of blocks one must pass through to reach it. Each block is covered by the convenience store that is nearest to it. The task is to find 'the blocks that are not covered by any existing convenience store but are capable of maximizing the coverage with a new store.' As a programmer for Debun Eleven, you need to develop a program that calculates the maximum number of blocks that can be covered based on the given block-separated map information and the locations of potential new stores.
