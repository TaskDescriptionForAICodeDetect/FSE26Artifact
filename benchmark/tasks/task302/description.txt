Taro has hidden a valuable book in his school locker and installed a button code lock in addition to the school-provided key. However, Taro has a habit of writing down his password in a single stroke, which is easy for him to forget. His rival, Jiro, found a piece of paper with 1000 potential passwords written on it and, knowing Taro's habit, decided to only test the passwords that can be formed in a single stroke. Your task is to implement a program that extracts only those candidate passwords from the provided list, following specific single-stroke rules.
