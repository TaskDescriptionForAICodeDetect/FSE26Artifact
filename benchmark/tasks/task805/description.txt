There are N men and N women, both numbered from 1 to N. For each pair of man i and woman j (1 ≤ i, j ≤ N), the compatibility is represented by an integer a_{i, j}. If a_{i, j} = 1, the man and woman are compatible; otherwise, they are not. Taro needs to find the number of ways to pair each man with a woman such that all pairs are compatible. Each man and woman can be part of exactly one pair. The result should be returned modulo 10^9 + 7.
