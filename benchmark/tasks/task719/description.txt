We have N points numbered 1 to N arranged in a line in this order. Takahashi decides to make an undirected graph, using these points as the vertices. In the beginning, the graph has no edge. Takahashi will do M operations to add edges in this graph. The i-th operation is as follows: For every pair of integers (s, t) such that L_i ≤ s < t ≤ R_i, add an edge of length C_i between Vertex s and Vertex t. Takahashi wants to solve the shortest path problem in the final graph obtained. Find the length of the shortest path from Vertex 1 to Vertex N in the final graph. If there is no shortest path, return -1 instead.
