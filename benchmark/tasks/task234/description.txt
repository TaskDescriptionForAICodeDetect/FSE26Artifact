A balloon placed on the ground is connected to one or more anchors on the ground with ropes. Each rope is long enough to connect the balloon and the anchor, and no two ropes cross each other. Your task is to find how high the balloon can go up while keeping the rope connections intact. The input consists of multiple datasets indicating the number of ropes and their respective anchor positions and lengths. The balloon is initially placed at (0, 0) on the ground and can ignore its size and the anchors. The output must be the maximum height that the balloon can achieve for each dataset, ensuring that the error does not exceed 0.00001.
