There was an explorer named Henry Nelson who stumbled upon an ancient building. To enter, he encountered a strange security system involving black and white panels arranged in a line that needed to be rearranged in a specific order. Henry could use a machine to swap any two panels, marked one at a time. The goal of this task is to write a program that calculates the minimum cost to rearrange the panels. The cost of moving the machine between adjacent panels is one unit, and you can start the machine at any position without incurring a cost. Each input dataset consists of the number of panels followed by their initial and final arrangements, and the output should display the minimum cost for each dataset.
