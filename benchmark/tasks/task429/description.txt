You are in a room tiled with hexagons, and your goal is to move from a starting point (sx, sy) to a destination point (gx, gy) based on the directions provided by 'All Exploration Sister'. She gives directions every minute, but her instructions may be random due to her inexperience with the hexagonal coordinate system. You have to comply with her directions as closely as possible while avoiding any obstacles (furniture) in the room and staying within defined movement limits. Your task is to determine the minimum number of times you need to ignore her directions to reach your goal. If you cannot reach your destination at all, return -1.
