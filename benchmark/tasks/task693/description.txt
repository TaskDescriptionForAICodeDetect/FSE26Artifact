We have a tree G with N vertices numbered 1 to N. The i-th edge of G connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i. Consider adding zero or more edges in G, and let H be the resulting graph. Find the number of graphs H that satisfy the following conditions, modulo 998244353: H does not contain self-loops or multiple edges. The diameters of G and H are equal. For every pair of vertices in H that is not directly connected by an edge, the addition of an edge directly connecting them would reduce the diameter of the graph.
