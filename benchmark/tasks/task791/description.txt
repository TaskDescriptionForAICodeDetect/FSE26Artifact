There is a very long bench divided into M sections where M is a very large integer. M people come to the bench one by one. A section is considered comfortable if it is unoccupied and not adjacent to any occupied sections. If there are no comfortable sections, a person leaves the bench. Otherwise, each person chooses one of the comfortable sections uniformly at random. After all M people have acted, Snuke selects an interval of N consecutive sections uniformly at random and takes a photo. This photo can be represented as a string of length N consisting of 'X' for occupied sections and '-' for unoccupied sections. Your task is to compute the limit of the probability that the photo matches a given string s as M approaches infinity, expressing the result in the form p + q/e + r/e^2, where p, q, and r are rational numbers. Output the three numbers modulo 10^9 + 7.
