JOI-kun is playing by hammering nails into a board in the shape of an equilateral triangle with N nails along each side. In the a-th row (1 ≤ a ≤ N), there are a nails arranged, and the b-th nail from the left is denoted as (a, b). A 'good triangle' is defined as an equilateral triangle with vertices that are either parallel to or aligned with the sides of the overall triangle, and it can be represented by the three nails (a, b), (a + x, b), and (a + x, b + x) where (1 ≤ a < N, 1 ≤ b ≤ a, 1 ≤ x ≤ N - a). JOI-kun wants to create an enclosing band with rubber bands around these 'good triangles'. The problem asks you to write a program that calculates the number of nails enclosed by one or more rubber bands given N (the number of nails on one side of the triangle) and M (the number of rubber bands) along with M lines of input specifying how the rubber bands enclose the 'good triangles'.
