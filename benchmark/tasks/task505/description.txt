You need to create a program that calculates the area of a window that is not covered by curtains. The window is defined as a polygon with given vertices, and the curtains are also defined as a rectangle with given vertices. You will be provided multiple datasets, where each dataset contains the number of vertices for the window, their coordinates, followed by the coordinates of the rectangle representing the curtains. The task is to output the area of the window that remains uncovered by the curtains for each dataset. The area should be an integer value.
