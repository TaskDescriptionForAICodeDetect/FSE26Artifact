The goal of the 15 puzzle problem is to arrange pieces on a 4x4 grid where one cell is an empty space, represented by 0. The pieces are represented by integers from 1 to 15. You can move a piece into the empty space in one step. The objective is to transform the initial configuration of the puzzle into the target configuration in the fewest number of moves. Write a program that reads an initial state of the puzzle and prints the fewest steps required to solve it.
