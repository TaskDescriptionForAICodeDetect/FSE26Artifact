In the country of Aizu, a relay race is held every year which involves N towns connected by direct paths. The race course is determined by finding the pair of towns with the longest shortest path between them. A monk named Tokuitsu, coming from Yamato, wishes to open a new temple in the quietest town that is not likely to be used in the relay race's course. Write a program to find all towns that cannot possibly be used in the relay course based on the given road information.
