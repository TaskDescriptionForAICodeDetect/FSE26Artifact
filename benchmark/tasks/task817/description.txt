Amidakuji is a traditional lottery method in Japan. To create an amidakuji, draw W parallel vertical lines and then draw horizontal lines connecting them. The vertical lines have a length of H+1 cm, and horizontal line endpoints must be at heights from 1 to H cm from the top of a vertical line. A valid amidakuji meets these conditions: no two horizontal lines share an endpoint, both endpoints of each horizontal line are at the same height, and each horizontal line connects adjacent vertical lines. Determine the number of valid amidakuji paths that, when traced from the top of the leftmost vertical line to the bottom, result in reaching the bottom of the K-th vertical line from the left. Return the answer modulo 1,000,000,007.
