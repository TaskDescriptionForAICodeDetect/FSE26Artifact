Snuke is making sugar water in a beaker. Initially, the beaker is empty. Snuke can perform the following four types of operations any number of times: pour 100A grams of water, pour 100B grams of water, put C grams of sugar, or put D grams of sugar into the beaker. E grams of sugar can dissolve into 100 grams of water. Snuke aims to make sugar water with the highest possible density without any undissolved sugar in the beaker and within a maximum capacity of F grams. Find the mass of the sugar water Snuke will make and the mass of sugar dissolved in it. If multiple valid configurations exist, any of them will be accepted. Pure water is considered 0 percent density sugar water.
