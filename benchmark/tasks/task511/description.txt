Help the Princess! In a certain kingdom, the revolutionary army is trying to catch the princess who is hiding in the royal palace. Your task is to write a program that determines if the princess can escape from the palace or not. The palace is represented as a rectangular grid with different types of cells: empty cells where both the princess and soldiers can move, and walls where they cannot move. The princess and soldiers can all move to adjacent empty cells or stay put during each time unit. If the princess and any soldiers end up in the same cell, the princess is caught. The goal is to determine if there exists a route for the princess to reach the escape hatch without being caught by the soldiers, even if the soldiers move optimally to reach her.
