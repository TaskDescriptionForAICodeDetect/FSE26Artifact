You are playing a video game where you must escape from a mysterious house filled with puzzles. One of the puzzles involves rotating a cube that controls a remote room. This room has a cubic shape with surfaces made up of 3x3 unit squares, and some squares have holes large enough for you to pass through. You need to rotate the cube so that at least one of the lower three squares on the front and back sides of the room has holes, allowing passage. The goal is to determine the minimum number of rotations needed to enable passage in the Dice Room.
