Given a positive integer N and a sequence of length 2^N consisting of 0s and 1s, determine whether there exists a closed curve C such that for all 2^N sets S from {0,1,...,N-1}, the curve can be continuously moved without touching a specific set of points while maintaining a negative y-coordinate for all points on the curve. If such a curve exists, construct one. A closed curve is defined as a continuous function from [0,1] to R^2 with specific movement and positioning constraints.
