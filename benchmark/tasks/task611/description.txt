Write a program that manipulates a sequence A = {a0, a1, ..., an-1} with operations to find the minimum element in a given range and to update elements. The program should support the following operations: find(s, t) to report the minimum element from as to at, and update(i, x) to change the value of ai to x. The initial values of ai are set to 231 - 1. The input should specify the number of elements n and the number of operations q, followed by q queries where '0' represents an update and '1' a find operation. The output should be the results of the find operations.
