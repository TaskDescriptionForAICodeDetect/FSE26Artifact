One day, the lord instructed a carpenter to build a large and sturdy building that townspeople could use for shelter during a typhoon or earthquake. To complete this sturdy building, large thick pillars are required. However, there are no such large pillars available in the town. Therefore, the carpenter must go to a distant mountain village to procure the large pillars (the carpenter needs to travel from the town to the mountain village and back). The carpenter's reward is the money received from the lord minus the cost of the pillars and travel expenses. As shown in the map below, there are various highways passing through different towns to reach the mountain village, and the travel cost varies between each pair of towns directly connected by a highway. To maximize the carpenter's reward, you need to determine the best route to take while procuring the pillars. Write a program that prints the maximum possible reward for the carpenter.
