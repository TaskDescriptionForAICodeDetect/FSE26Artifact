You have wandered into a large mansion. This mansion consists of square rooms arranged in a grid with M rows east-west and N rows north-south, for a total of M x N rooms. The room located at x columns from the west and y rows from the south is represented as (x, y). Each pair of adjacent rooms is connected by a door, which can either be closed (not passable) or open (passable). Moving between open doors takes 1 minute. Some rooms contain switches which, when pressed for 1 minute, toggle the state of all doors in the mansion. Initially, all east-west connecting doors are closed and all north-south connecting doors are open. Starting from the center of room (1, 1), write a program to determine the minimum time required to reach the center of room (M, N). If it is impossible to reach room (M, N), indicate that.
