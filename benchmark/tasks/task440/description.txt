In the Hakone Ekiden, a famous New Year event in Japan, each team has 10 runners who pass a baton at relay stations while aiming for the finish line. The broadcast displays the rankings of each team at each relay station along with changes in their ranks from the previous station. Based on this information, determine how many possible orders there could be for teams passing through the previous relay station. Since the number of possible orders can be very large, provide the result modulo 1,000,000,007.
