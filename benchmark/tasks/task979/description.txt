AtCoDeer the deer has N square tiles, each numbered from 1 to N, with numbers written on one side and corners painted in one of 1000 colors. The corners are defined for each tile number i as C_{i,0}, C_{i,1}, C_{i,2}, and C_{i,3}. AtCoDeer aims to construct a cube using six of these tiles under specific conditions: each tile must have the number facing outward, and all three corners forming each vertex of the cube must be painted the same color. You need to find the number of different cubes that can be constructed, considering different sets and orientations of tiles. Cubes are deemed the same only if they can be transformed into each other through rotation in three-dimensional space.
