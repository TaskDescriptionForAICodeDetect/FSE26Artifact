Dance Now! - The problem involves a competition called 'Lab Life' where units compete in three categories: Smile, Pure, and Cool. Points are awarded based on the rankings in these categories, and the total score determines the overall rank. The goal is to determine the minimum increase needed in any one of the three values (Smile, Pure, Cool) for the character 'Dosanko Snow' to avoid being ranked 9th, by achieving at least a tied rank of 8th.
