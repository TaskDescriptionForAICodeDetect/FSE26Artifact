Tarou is an elementary school student who is doodling on the back of a flyer. One day, he came up with a game where he draws an n x n grid. The state of each cell can either have a circle drawn in it or not. The objective is to ensure that in every row and column there is exactly one circle. If this condition is met, the game is considered cleared. Tarou has difficulty completing the game, so he seeks your help as a university student. Your task is to minimize the operational cost to achieve this goal given the cost of adding or removing circles in the cells. You need to write a program that outputs the minimum cost and the steps to reach this state. The program should print the minimum cost, the number of operations performed, each operation detailing the row, column, and whether it was an addition or removal of a circle.
