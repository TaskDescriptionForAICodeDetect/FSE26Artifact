You have found a unique nesting doll while traveling and purchased N dolls. Each doll is a rectangular prism with dimensions xi × yi × zi. After admiring the dolls, you want to store them to minimize the total visible volume of the dolls. You can nest one doll inside another if the outer doll has not already nested another doll inside it, and the inner doll's dimensions are smaller than the outer doll's dimensions in all directions. You need to write a program to determine the minimum total volume of the visible dolls after potentially nesting them.
