Differential Pulse Code Modulation is a compression technique mainly used for audio signals. The audio signal is treated as a series of integers (impulse sequence) obtained by sampling the input signal at regular time intervals and recording the amplitude. The integers tend to have consecutive values that are close to each other. Differential Pulse Code Modulation encodes the difference between consecutive values to improve compression rates. In this problem, you need to select a sequence of outputs from a predefined set of values (codebook) such that the sum of the squared differences between the original input signal and the decoded output signal is minimized. The starting value of the output signal is set to 128 and must be clipped between 0 and 255. Your task is to write a program that finds the sequence minimizing the squared difference and outputs that minimum sum for each dataset.
