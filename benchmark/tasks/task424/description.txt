The Milky Way Transportation Corporation is a travel agency that plans and operates interstellar travel tours. They are currently planning a tour called the 'Milky Way Crossing Hikoboshi and Orihime Experience Tour'. This tour departs from Vega in the Lyra constellation and travels through the stars towards Altair in the Aquila constellation. As an employee of the Milky Way Transportation Corporation, you are responsible for selecting the route for the tour. For simplicity, the Milky Way is treated as a 2D coordinate system, and the stars are represented by pentacles. The spaceship used for the tour has a special engine that allows it to move along the lines of the pentacles without using energy, while moving between the pentacles requires energy proportional to the distance traveled. Given the recent decline in the corporation's sales, there is a need to save costs, including the energy costs for the spaceship. Your task is to write a program that finds the route from Vega to Altair that minimizes the total interstellar travel distance and outputs this total.
