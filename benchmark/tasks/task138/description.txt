Create a program to calculate the area and perimeter of the regions covered by several rectangular sheets placed on a plane. The placement of the sheets must meet the following conditions: (1) All four vertex coordinates (x, y) of each rectangle are integers between 0 and 10000, and each edge of the rectangle is parallel to either the x-axis or the y-axis. (2) The number of sheets is at most 10000. The input file is named 'input.txt'. The first line contains the number of rectangles n and an integer r representing the type of query. From the second line onwards, each line contains the coordinates of the bottom-left (x1, y1) and top-right (x2, y2) vertices of each sheet. The output file is named 'output.txt'. If r = 1, write the area on the first line; if r = 2, write the area on the first line and the perimeter on the second line. Each case should end with a newline.
