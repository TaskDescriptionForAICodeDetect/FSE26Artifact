There is a frog in a pond that loves jumping between floating lotus leaves, which sink after being jumped on. The frog starts on a specific leaf and faces one of four directions: up, down, left, or right. The frog can jump forward or to the left or right relative to its facing direction, but not backward or diagonally. After each jump, it faces the direction it jumped into. The goal is to determine a sequence of jumps until only one leaf remains. Given the grid setup, you need to output a series of movements (U, D, L, R) that leads to the solution.
