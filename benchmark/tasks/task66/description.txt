You need to write a program that reads the coordinates of nails placed at points P1 (x1, y1), P2 (x2, y2), ..., Pn (xn, yn) on a plane, and counts the number of nails that are not touched by a rubber band that encompasses these nails without crossing itself. The rubber band is assumed to stretch infinitely. No two nails will share the same coordinates, and no more than two nails will be aligned along the same line connecting the nails inside the rubber band. You need to process multiple datasets, and for each dataset, output the number of nails not touching the rubber band. The dataset ends when n is given as 0, which indicates the end of input. The coordinates of the nails are real numbers within the range of -1000.0 to 1000.0, and n will be an integer between 3 and 100, with a maximum of 50 datasets.
