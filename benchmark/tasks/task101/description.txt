In a mystical land called Narawanda, explorers Bob and Mike sought the legendary gold hidden deep within a cave. They reached the final door adorned with many isosceles triangles. When one triangle is touched, it illuminates a rectangular light that connects to another triangle, causing a chain reaction of illumination. All triangles are isosceles, of equal size, and do not overlap or touch each other, and the light extends a fixed distance. Bob discovered a message warning not to touch indiscriminately; the objective is to touch as few triangles as necessary to illuminate all of them and open the door. Write a program that takes the number of triangles on the door, the distance the light extends, and the coordinates of the triangle vertices as input, and outputs the minimum number of touches required to illuminate all triangles. Consider two points the same if their distance is 0.01 or less, and a point is on a line if the distance is 0.01 or less.
