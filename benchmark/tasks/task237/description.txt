A professor of anthropology collected family trees from isolated islands for an experiment. The family trees are represented in text files where each line contains a person's name, and children are indented relative to their parents. The professor also collected statements about relations between individuals in the family trees and needs to determine the truthfulness of these statements. The input consists of several datasets, each containing a family tree and a set of statements to evaluate. The task is to output 'True' or 'False' for each statement based on the relationships defined in the family tree.
