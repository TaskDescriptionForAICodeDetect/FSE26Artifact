You are organizing an art exhibition where several paintings need to be framed and displayed in a row from left to right. You have $N$ candidate paintings, each numbered from 1 to $N$, with painting $i$ having a size $S_i$ and a value $V_i$. You also have $M$ frames, each numbered from 1 to $M$, with frame $j$ having a size $C_j$. Only paintings with sizes less than or equal to $C_j$ can be placed in frame $j$, and each frame can hold at most one painting. All paintings in the exhibition must be placed in some frame. To enhance the visual appeal, the following conditions must be met: (1) For any two adjacent paintings, the frame of the right painting must be equal to or larger than the frame of the left painting, and (2) the value of the right painting must be equal to or larger than that of the left painting. Your task is to write a program that determines the maximum number of paintings that can be displayed given the number of candidate paintings, the number of frames, and their respective sizes and values.
