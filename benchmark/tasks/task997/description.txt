We have a large square grid with H rows and W columns. Iroha is currently at the top-left cell and she will repeatedly move right or down to adjacent cells until she reaches the bottom-right cell. However, she cannot enter the cells in the intersection of the bottom A rows and the leftmost B columns, which creates AÃ—B forbidden cells. Find the number of ways she can travel to the bottom-right cell. Since this number can be extremely large, return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.
