Gilbert, the network admin, needs to reconstruct the network topology of computers and switches from a series of distance matrices that represent the distances between pairs of computers. Each computer is connected to one switch, and switches are connected to form a tree structure. Your job is to write a program that processes these distance matrices and outputs the degree of each internal node (switch) in ascending order.
