You are asked to implement a program that performs several operations on an N x N square matrix based on given commands. Operations include writing a value to a cell, copying values between cells, swapping rows and columns, rotating the entire matrix, and reflecting it horizontally or vertically. Finally, compute a hash value from specific cells of the final matrix using specified coefficients and output this hash value.
