A person related to JOI works at a toy store. Today, they need to organize the plush toy section in the store. The shelf in the plush toy section has N plush toys arranged in a row, divided into N sections. Each section can hold one plush toy. The toy store sells a total of M types of plush toys, numbered from 1 to M. Each plush toy on the shelf is one of these M types, and at least one plush toy of each type is guaranteed to exist. To enhance the visual appeal, you want to rearrange the plush toys so that all toys of the same type are placed consecutively on the shelf. The rearrangement can be done as follows: select some of the N plush toys, remove them from the shelf without changing the positions of the remaining toys, and return the removed plush toys to any vacant positions on the shelf. After rearranging, all plush toys of the same type must be placed consecutively. Write a program to determine the minimum number of plush toys that need to be removed to achieve this arrangement.
