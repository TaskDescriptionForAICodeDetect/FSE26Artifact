We have an H Ã— W grid, where each square is painted white or black in the initial state. Given strings A_1, A_2, ..., A_H represent the colors of the squares. Each square is white if the corresponding character is '.', and black if it's '#'. Among the 2^{HW} ways to paint each square, determine how many can be obtained from the initial state by performing the following operations any number of times (possibly zero) in any order: paint all squares in a chosen row white, paint all squares in a chosen row black, paint all squares in a chosen column white, and paint all squares in a chosen column black. Find this count modulo 998,244,353.
