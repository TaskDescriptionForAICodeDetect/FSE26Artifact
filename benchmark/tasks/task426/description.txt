Sister Ports: In the ACM country, there are n ports arranged as vertices of a regular n-gon, with roads connecting adjacent ports. In addition, there are m internal roads connecting some pairs of non-adjacent ports. The goal is to determine the total number of ways to choose pairs of sister ports such that there is a road connecting each pair. Each port can only be part of one pair, and there must not be any road between sister ports. Calculate the total configurations of sister port pairs modulo 1000003. If no valid pairing exists, return 0.
