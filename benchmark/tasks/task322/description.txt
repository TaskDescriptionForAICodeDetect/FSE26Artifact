You have a number of tally counters arranged in a row, where each button press increases the counter by one, and when reaching the maximum, it resets to one. Given the initial values on each counter and the target values you want to achieve, determine the minimum number of operations needed to change all counters to their respective target values. An operation allows you to push buttons on one or more adjacent counters simultaneously.
