We have N cards numbered 1 to N. Each card i has an integer A_i on one side (red ink) and an integer B_i on the other side (blue ink). Initially, the cards display the red numbers. Your goal is to determine whether it's possible to rearrange the cards to create a non-decreasing sequence with the numbers facing up by performing a series of operations. An operation consists of selecting two adjacent cards, swapping them, and flipping them. If it's possible, return the minimum number of operations required. If it's impossible, return -1.
