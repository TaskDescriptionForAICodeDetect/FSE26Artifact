There is a grid with N rows and N columns of squares. Each square can be painted in one of C colors. Initially, each square (i,j) is painted in color c_{i,j}. A grid is considered good if squares with the same (i+j) % 3 value have the same color, and squares with different (i+j) % 3 values have different colors. You need to repaint some squares to make the grid good while minimizing the total 'wrongness' caused by the repaints. The wrongness for changing color from X to Y is represented by D_{X,Y}. Your task is to find the minimum possible sum of wrongness for all squares.
