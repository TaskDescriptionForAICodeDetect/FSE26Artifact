The task is to simulate the process of students requesting pages from reference books in a library, where a librarian manages the requests related to book accessibility. The students form a queue to request copies of books, and the librarian retrieves books from shelves and desks while managing limited space on the desks. Costs are associated with accessing desks and shelves, and the objective is to calculate the total cost of processing all the requests for multiple datasets provided in a specific format.
