There is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N. The edges of the tree are denoted by (x_i, y_i). Alice and Bob play a game where they alternately select an existing edge and remove it from the tree, disconnecting it into two separate connected components. Then, they remove the component that does not contain Vertex 1. A player loses if they cannot perform the operation. Determine the winner of the game assuming both players play optimally.
