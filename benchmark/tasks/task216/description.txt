Write a program to calculate the minimum time required for special agent Jack to climb a cliff covered with blocks. Jack starts from the bottom row of the cliff where blocks are marked with 'S' and must reach the top row where blocks are marked with 'T'. The blocks have varying slippery levels that denote the time in units Jack must spend to step on them (from '1' to '9'). Jack cannot step on blocks marked with 'X'. His movements are restricted; he can only step left and right on specific blocks within a defined range under the constraints of foot positions.
