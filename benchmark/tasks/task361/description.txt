There is a cloud floating above the town where Natsume lives, and angels reside in that cloud. Like Natsume, the angels love cats and often descend to the ground to play with them. To descend, the angel created a long staircase connecting the cloud to the ground. However, to make it more interesting, the angel devised a way for the steps to produce sounds when stepped on, allowing music to be played while descending. The music is made up of 12 distinct musical notes: C, C#, D, D#, E, F, F#, G, G#, A, A#, B. The difference between adjacent notes is called a semitone. The staircase consists of n white plates, each assigned one of the 12 notes. The goal is to determine if the angel can play a given song while descending from the cloud to the ground. The angel can move to the adjacent steps but follows specific rules for producing sounds based on the step they land on. The program should output 'Yes' if the angel can perform the song while descending, and 'No' if not. The input consists of multiple datasets.
