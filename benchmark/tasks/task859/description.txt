There are N holes in a two-dimensional plane, each defined by coordinates (x_i, y_i). Given a very large radius R, Ringo randomly chooses a point inside a circle of this radius, and Snuke moves to the nearest hole based on Euclidean distance. If multiple holes have the same distance, Snuke falls into the hole with the smallest index. Your task is to compute the probability that Snuke will fall into each of the N holes. The random point is chosen such that its coordinates (x, y) are uniformly selected from [-R, R], and the point is valid if it lies within the circle defined by x^2 + y^2 <= R^2. You will need to report the probability for each hole with a precision of at most 10^-5.
