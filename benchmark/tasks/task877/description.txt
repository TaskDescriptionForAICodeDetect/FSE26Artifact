Ringo has a string S. He can perform N kinds of operations any number of times in any order. An operation involves replacing each character from the L_i-th to the R_i-th characters in S with its succeeding letter in the English alphabet, wrapping around such that 'z' becomes 'a'. Ringo loves palindromes and wants to know if it's possible to turn S into a palindrome using these operations. Determine whether this is possible.
