You are a supporter of candidate X in the upcoming election. X plans to give a street speech at a location where as many voters as possible can see him. The area around the station contains N obstacles represented as polygons and M voters represented as points on a two-dimensional plane. A voter can see X if there is no obstacle along the line segment connecting X's position and the voter's position. Your job is to determine the location where the most voters can see X, and find how many voters can see him at maximum.
