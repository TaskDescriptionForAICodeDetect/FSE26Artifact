Fennec and Snuke are playing a board game on a tree-structured board with N cells and N-1 roads connecting them. The game starts with Cell 1 painted black and Cell N painted white. Fennec and Snuke take turns painting uncolored cells adjacent to black and white cells, respectively. The objective is to determine the winner when both play optimally. A player loses when they cannot make a move.
