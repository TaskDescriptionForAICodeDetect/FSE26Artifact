In the country of Water Deven, there are n cities connected by m bridges. Each city is isolated by water. Due to a recent revision of road budgets, the maintenance costs of the bridges must be minimized, and some bridges will need to be dismantled while ensuring that all cities remain reachable from one another. Your task is to write a program that, given the number of cities, the number of bridges, and the maintenance cost for each bridge, calculates the minimum total maintenance cost after dismantling the necessary bridges, considering that dismantling does not incur any cost. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
