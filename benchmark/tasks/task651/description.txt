There are K items placed on a grid of squares with R rows and C columns. The i-th item is located at (r_i, c_i) and has the value v_i. Takahashi will start at (1, 1) and must reach (R, C) by moving only down or to the right. He can collect items from the squares he visits but can take at most three items from each row. The goal is to find the maximum possible sum of the values of the items he picks up.
