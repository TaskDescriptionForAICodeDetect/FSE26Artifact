Mizuyokan is a Japanese sweet made primarily from red bean paste, poured into a mold and solidified with agar. JOI has a Mizuyokan in the shape of a long rectangular prism and plans to eat it as a snack today. This Mizuyokan contains N-1 vertical cuts, and its total length is L_1 + L_2 + ... + L_N. The i-th cut is located at the position where the total length is L_1 + L_2 + ... + L_i from the left. Since the Mizuyokan is too large to eat whole, JOI will select one or more cuts and slice the Mizuyokan along those cuts into multiple pieces. However, to make the appearance better, he wants the difference between the maximum length of pieces and the minimum length of pieces to be as small as possible. Your task is to find the minimum difference between the longest and shortest pieces' lengths.
