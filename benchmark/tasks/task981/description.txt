You need to write a program that queries the status of a long blackboard, divided into 2 rows and N columns, using a retrieval device. The program must generate search queries to check if certain rectangles (sub-blackboards) exist on the blackboard. The status remains fixed and you must minimize the number of queries made. The program should handle input corresponding to the blackboard length and form search queries using specific representations for used and unused cells. The output must be flushed after each query. The program must terminate when the whole blackboard is queried or when the query limit of 420 is exceeded.
