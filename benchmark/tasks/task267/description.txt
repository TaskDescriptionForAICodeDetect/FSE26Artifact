The goddess of programming is reviewing a logbook of visitors to her altar, where she chooses a programmer to receive a gift based on their time spent at the altar during her presence. Your task is to write a program that calculates the total blessed time (time spent with the goddess) of each programmer from the logbook entries. The programmer with the longest blessed time will be endowed. The logbook entries include timestamps for arrivals and departures for both the goddess and the programmers. The output should be the total blessed time in minutes for the programmer who spent the most time during the goddess's presence.
