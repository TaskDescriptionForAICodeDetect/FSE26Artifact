Snuke found a random number generator that generates an integer between 0 and 2^N-1. There is an integer sequence A_0, A_1, ..., A_{2^N-1} that represents the probability of generating each integer. When an integer v is generated, it replaces X with X XOR v. Given this, for every integer i from 0 to 2^N-1, find the expected number of operations until X becomes i, and print it modulo 998244353 as a unique integer R such that R * Q â‰¡ P mod 998244353. The expected number of operations until X becomes i is a finite rational number.
