Snuke loves colorful balls. He has a total of NÃ—K balls, K in each of his favorite N colors. The colors are numbered 1 through N. He will arrange all of the balls in a row from left to right, in arbitrary order. Then, for each of the N colors, he will paint the leftmost ball of that color into color 0, a color different from any of the N original colors. After painting, how many sequences of the colors of the balls are possible? Find this number modulo 10^9+7.
