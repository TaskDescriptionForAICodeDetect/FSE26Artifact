AtCoDeer is thinking of painting an infinite two-dimensional grid in a checked pattern of side K, where each square is either black or white in such a way that each connected component of each color forms a K Ã— K square. Given N desires, where each desire consists of a coordinate (x_i, y_i) and a color (B for black and W for white), determine the maximum number of desires that can be satisfied at the same time. Each coordinate (x_i, y_i) is distinct.
