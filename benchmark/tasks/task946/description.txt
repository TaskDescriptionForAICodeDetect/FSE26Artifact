There are N integers written on a blackboard. The i-th integer is A_i, and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers is 1. Takahashi and Aoki will play a game using these integers. In this game, starting from Takahashi, the two players alternately perform the following operation: Select one integer on the blackboard that is not less than 2, subtract 1 from that integer, and then divide all the integers on the blackboard by g, where g is the GCD of the integers on the blackboard. The player who is left with only 1s on the blackboard and thus cannot perform the operation loses the game. Assuming both players play optimally, determine the winner of the game.
