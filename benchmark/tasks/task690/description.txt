For a non-negative integer K, a fractal of level K is defined as a 3^K x 3^K grid. At level 0, it consists of one white square. For K > 0, the center subgrid of a 3^K grid is black, and the other eight subgrids are fractals of level K-1. You are given Q quadruples of integers (a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i), and for each quadruple, you need to find the distance from (a_i, b_i) to (c_i, d_i). The distance is defined as the minimum integer n such that there exists a sequence of white squares starting from (a, b) to (c, d), where each consecutive square shares a side. Constraints include 1 ≤ Q ≤ 10,000 and 1 ≤ a_i, b_i, c_i, d_i ≤ 3^30, with (a_i, b_i) not equal to (c_i, d_i) and both being white squares.
