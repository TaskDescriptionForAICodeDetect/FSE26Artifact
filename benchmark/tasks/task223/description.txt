There are many blue cards and red cards on the table, each with an integer number greater than 1 printed on them. A blue and a red card can be paired if their numbers share a common divisor greater than 1. The goal is to find the maximum number of pairs that can be formed from the given sets of blue and red cards. The input consists of multiple datasets, each specifying counts and values of blue and red cards. For each dataset, output the maximum number of pairs that can be formed.
