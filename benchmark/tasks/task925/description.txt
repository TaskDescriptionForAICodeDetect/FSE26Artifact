You are given an integer sequence of length N. The i-th term in the sequence is a_i. In one operation, you can select a term and either increment or decrement it by one. At least how many operations are necessary to satisfy the following conditions? For every i (1≤i≤n), the sum of the terms from the 1st through the i-th term is not zero. For every i (1≤i≤n-1), the sign of the sum of the terms from the 1st through the i-th term is different from the sign of the sum of the terms from the 1st through the (i+1)-th term.
