You are given the number of notches N on a Baumkuchen (a type of cake) and the sizes A1, A2, ..., AN of the segments between the notches. The task is to write a program that calculates and outputs the maximum possible size of the smallest piece when the cake is cut into three pieces at the notches. The cuts can only be made at the notches, and you should find positions for the cuts that optimize the size of the smallest piece.
