We have a tree with N vertices, where the i-th edge connects Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i. Each vertex i has an integer a_i written on it. For every integer k from 1 to N, create a sequence of integers from the shortest path between Vertex 1 and Vertex k. Determine the length of the longest increasing subsequence from this sequence. The longest increasing subsequence is the subsequence with the maximum possible size such that the elements are in increasing order and selected from the sequence's original order.
