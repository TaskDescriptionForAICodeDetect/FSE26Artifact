The task is to modify the values of coins in a currency system to make it beautiful, meaning that each coin's value must be an integer and the value of the (i+1)-th smallest coin must be divisible by the i-th smallest coin for all i. You want to minimize the maximum confusion ratio, defined as |a_i - b_i| / a_i, where a_i is the original coin value and b_i is the modified coin value. You cannot add or remove coins, only modify their values. Output the minimum of the maximum confusion ratios.
