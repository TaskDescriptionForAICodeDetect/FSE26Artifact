At CoDeer, the goal is to create a directed graph that fulfills specific conditions. The graph can have up to 300 vertices numbered from 1 to N, without self-loops or multiple edges. Each edge can either have an integer weight from 0 to 100 or be labeled X or Y. For every pair of integers (x, y) where 1 ≤ x ≤ A and 1 ≤ y ≤ B, the shortest distance from Vertex S to Vertex T must correspond to a specified distance d_(x,y) when edges labeled X have weight x and edges labeled Y have weight y. Your task is to construct this graph (including vertices S and T) or determine if it is impossible to create such a graph.
