There is a rectangular maze consisting of square cells arranged in rows and columns. You start from the cell 'S' and aim to reach the goal cell 'G' by moving to adjacent cells in the north, south, east, or west directions. The types of cells are plains, mountains, and ice. Both 'S' and 'G' are placed on plain cells, which you can move through. Mountain cells cannot be navigated. Ice cells are traversable but can break under certain conditions. Ice cells are treated as a single entity, and if you move to more than half of the ice cells within a chunk, the whole chunk breaks and becomes impassable. Your task is to create a program that will calculate the minimum number of steps required to go from 'S' to 'G'. Input consists of several datasets with the first line indicating the dimensions of the maze, followed by lines representing the maze.
