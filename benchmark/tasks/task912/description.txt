You need to find the occurrences of each letter in the lowercase English alphabet from the l-th character to the r-th character of the string obtained by repeatedly applying the function f on an even string S a total of 10^100 times. An even string is a string that can be formed by concatenating two equal strings. For a non-empty string S, the function f(S) generates the shortest even string by appending characters to S. The task is to return a list of 26 integers representing the count of occurrences for each letter from 'a' to 'z'.
