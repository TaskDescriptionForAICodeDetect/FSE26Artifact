For a set S of integers, perform a sequence of operations where each value in S must be unique. The operations include insert(x) which inserts x into S and reports the count of elements, find(x) which reports the presence of x in S as 0 or 1, delete(x) which removes x from S, and dump(L, R) which prints elements in S within the range [L, R] in ascending order.
