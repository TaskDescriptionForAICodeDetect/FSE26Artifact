You are a night watchman in an office building, responsible for ensuring all the lights are off after the workers leave. Each floor is a grid of rooms with lights and toggle switches. Changing a toggle switch in a room affects the lights in that room and others within a specified Manhattan distance. Your goal is to determine if it's possible to turn off all the lights on a floor based on the current states of the lights and the Manhattan distance provided.
