Hokkaido University Easy involves finding the maximum distance between two buildings on a large campus represented by a grid. The grid is described by its height (H) and width (W) with each cell indicating either a building ('B') or an empty space ('.'). The distance between two buildings at positions (i,j) and (i',j') is defined as the Manhattan distance |i-i'| + |j-j'|. You need to calculate and return the maximum distance between any two buildings.
