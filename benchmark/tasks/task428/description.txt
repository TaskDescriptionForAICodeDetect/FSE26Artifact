Yayoi, a super popular idol, has acrophobia and must complete a challenge in a room with square tiles. The room has some gaps (holes) in the tiles, and if she falls through a hole, she will drop into a pool below. The challenge is to start from a designated place, collect all the scrolls located in the room, and reach the goal point as quickly as possible. Yayoi can move only to adjacent tiles (up, down, left, right), with different time costs depending on her proximity to the holes. Moving to a tile far from the holes takes 1 second, while moving to a tile close to holes takes longer, depending on how many holes are nearby. Your task is to write a program that calculates the shortest time to complete the challenge by collecting all scrolls and reaching the goal.
