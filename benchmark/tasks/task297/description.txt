Susan needs to reorder a stack of documents with serial numbers in increasing order. Given a stack of documents from top to bottom, she can move them to two temporary piles, ensuring that the temporary piles do not exceed a certain height and that documents in each pile are in reverse order. Your task is to write a program that computes the number of different ways to stack the documents into the two piles according to these rules. If it's not possible to achieve the objective, the output should be zero.
