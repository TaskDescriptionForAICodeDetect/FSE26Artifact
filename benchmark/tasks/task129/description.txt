Bob is playing a game called 'Dungeon' on a rectangular board with dimensions W x H. He controls a character named 'BomBom', who starts at position (0, 0), and must destroy all enemy characters located on certain squares of the board. BomBom can move one square in any direction (up, down, left, right) at a cost, and can use a bomb to eliminate all enemies in the same row and column without any cost. The goal is to determine the minimum cost incurred by BomBom to clear the board of all enemies.
