Consider a string with rings at both ends. Each ring has a positive integer, distinguishing the strings. The rings at both ends have different numbers a and b. This is denoted as [a, b]. There are multiple strings, and if two strings have the same number on their rings, they can be connected at that ring, forming what is called a chain. For example, from [1, 3] and [3, 4], one can create a chain [1, 3, 4]. Strings and chains can also be connected at the same integer rings. Various shapes can be formed this way, but some of them are defined as chains where each ring with the same number is traversed only once. For instance, the shape formed by chains [1, 3, 4] and [2, 3, 5] includes chains [1, 3, 5] and [2, 3, 4], and the shape from [1, 3, 4] and [4, 6, 1] includes chains like [1, 3, 4, 6], [3, 4, 6, 1], etc. The length of a chain is defined as the number of unique integers it contains. Given multiple strings, when all connectable strings are connected, at least one chain is created. Write a program to find the maximum length of any chain.
