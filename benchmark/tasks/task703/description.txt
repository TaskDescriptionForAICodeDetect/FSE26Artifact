We have a tree with N vertices numbered 1 to N. The i-th edge in this tree connects Vertex a_i and Vertex b_i. Consider painting each of these edges white or black. There are 2^(N-1) such ways to paint the edges. Among them, how many satisfy all of the following M restrictions? The i-th restriction is represented by two integers u_i and v_i, which mean that the path connecting Vertex u_i and Vertex v_i must contain at least one edge painted black. The task is to output the number of ways to paint the edges that satisfy all of the M conditions.
