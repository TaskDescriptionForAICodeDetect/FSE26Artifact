Given two strings s and t consisting of lowercase English letters, determine if the number of non-negative integers i that satisfy a specific condition is finite, and find the maximum value of such i if the number is finite. The condition is that there exists a non-negative integer j such that the concatenation of i copies of t is a substring of the concatenation of j copies of s. If the number of such i is infinite, return -1.
