In a laboratory, Nathan Wada is measuring weight differences between sample pieces pair by pair using a balance. You need to develop a program that records measurement results and automatically computes weight differences between specified pairs of samples based on the measurement results provided. Each dataset includes measurement results that state one sample is heavier than another by a certain weight, and inquiries that ask for the weight difference between two samples. You should handle multiple datasets and provide results for each inquiry.
