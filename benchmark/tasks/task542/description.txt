The problem is based on Hokkaido University, which is known for its extremely large campus. The campus can be represented as a rectangular grid of size H x W, where each cell can either contain a building ('B') or be empty ('.'). The objective is to find the maximum distance between any two cells containing buildings. The distance between two cells (i, j) and (i', j') is defined as the Manhattan distance: |i - i'| + |j - j'|. You need to output an integer representing this maximum distance.
