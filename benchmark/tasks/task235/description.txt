Mr. C is a vampire who must avoid sunlight to remain safe. Given the radius of the sun and the silhouettes of buildings modeled as rectangles on a 2D plane, write a program to compute the time of the last moment when the sunlight is blocked before it reaches the horizon. The input consists of multiple datasets, each specifying the sun's radius and building silhouettes. The output should be the last moment in time when the sunlight is completely blocked.
