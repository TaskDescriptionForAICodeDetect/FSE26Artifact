In the JAG Kingdom, each domestic airport is assigned an airport code for identification. The airport code is based on the airport's name represented by lowercase English letters and is assigned according to the following rule: Take the first letter of the name and the letter immediately following the vowels (a, i, u, e, o) in order. If the resulting string is less than k characters long, use it as the airport code; if it is k characters or longer, use the first k characters as the airport code. The task is to determine if it is possible to assign unique airport codes to all airports based on the provided algorithm. If possible, find the minimum k for which all airport codes are distinct, and if impossible, indicate that as well.
