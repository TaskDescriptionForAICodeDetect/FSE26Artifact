There is an undirected connected graph with N vertices and N-1 edges. The i-th edge connects vertices u_i and v_i. The coder, E869120, moves in the graph as follows: He moves to an adjacent vertex, but he can't visit a vertex two or more times. He ends his move when there is no way to move. Otherwise, he moves randomly. If he has p ways to move this turn, he chooses each vertex with a probability of 1/p. Calculate the expected value of the number of turns it takes for E869120 to start from vertex i, for all i (1 ≤ i ≤ N).
