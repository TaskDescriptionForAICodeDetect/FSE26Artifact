Takahashi and Aoki are playing a game where they will continue until one of them achieves N wins. The probabilities of Takahashi winning, Aoki winning, and the game ending in a draw are given as A%, B%, and C% respectively. Calculate the expected number of games that will be played, and represent the expected value as P/Q where P and Q are coprime integers. Print the integer R such that R * Q â‰¡ P (mod 10^9 + 7).
