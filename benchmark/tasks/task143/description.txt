Taro, who lives in JOI town, has decided to take a daily walk for health improvement. In JOI town, there are (H + 1) east-west roads and (W + 1) north-south roads arranged in a grid pattern. Taro's house is located at the northwestern intersection, and he starts his walk from there. Each intersection can be represented as (a, b), with Taro's house at (1, 1). Taro writes 'East' or 'South' at each intersection leading from (1, 1) to (H, W) and walks according to certain rules: when at an intersection marked 'East', he changes it to 'South' and moves to the next intersection in the east direction, and vice versa for 'South'. The walk ends when he reaches the easternmost or southernmost roads. After planning, Taro is curious about the route he will take on his N-th outing. Write a program to predict the route for Taro's N-th walk.
