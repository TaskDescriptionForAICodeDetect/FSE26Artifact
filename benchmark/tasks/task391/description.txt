To achieve good results in ICPC, training is essential. The rabbit wants to win in ICPC, so it decided to train today. Today's training involves running on a straight path to improve stamina and judgment. The rabbit is currently at the starting line looking down a long road. Along the way, there are several carrots placed which the rabbit can eat to accelerate. When not eating carrots, the rabbit runs at a speed of U meters per second, but by eating a carrot, the rabbit's speed increases to V meters per second for T seconds after eating the last carrot. The rabbit can hold up to K carrots without eating them. Holding or eating carrots takes no time, and the goal is to determine the shortest time needed to reach the goal.
