Given a string S consisting of the characters 0, 1, or ?, create a new string S' by replacing each ? with either 0 or 1. Your goal is to find the minimum possible unbalancedness of S', defined as the maximum absolute difference between the number of 0s and 1s in any substring S'[l:r] (inclusive), with 1 <= l <= r <= |S|.
