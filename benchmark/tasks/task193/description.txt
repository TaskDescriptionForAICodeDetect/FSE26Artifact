Jon, the leader of killifish, needs to determine the safest location for a school he wants to build in a pond represented as a 2D grid. Each cell in the grid has a dangerousness value, and the goal is to identify the lowest dangerousness value within specified subgrids based on provided queries. The input consists of multiple datasets, each specifying the grid dimensions, the grid values, and a number of queries to find the minimum dangerousness in the specified subgrids.
