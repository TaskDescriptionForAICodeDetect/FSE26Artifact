There are N villages, each numbered from 1 to N. Due to a recent merger trend, some villages are to be merged into new municipalities, while those that are not merged remain as villages. You are provided with information about pairs of villages that will merge into the same municipality. The information may lead to the merging of three or more villages into a single municipality. Your task is to output the absolute difference between the number of villages and the number of municipalities after all mergers have taken place.
