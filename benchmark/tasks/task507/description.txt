You need to create a program that determines the number of possible score arrangements for baseball matches between team X and team Y based on given results. The input consists of multiple datasets, each representing the number of matches won by each team and their total scores. The output should provide the count of possible arrangements modulo 1,000,000,007. A match is considered won by team X if it scores more than team Y, and a draw occurs if scores are equal. The order of matches must be taken into account as different arrangements are considered distinct. The process should continue until a line with five zeros is encountered, which indicates the end of input.
