Develop a deciphering program that finds the plaintext messages from given ciphertext messages using a substitution cipher. Each substitution rule consists of pairs of letters, where each letter in a pair can be substituted with the other. A ciphertext message contains one or more words generated from a plaintext word using a substitution rule, and the program needs to determine the original plaintext based on a list of candidate words.
