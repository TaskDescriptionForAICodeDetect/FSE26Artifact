There are N cities in the Republic of AtCoder. The size of the i-th city is A_i. Takahashi would like to build N-1 bidirectional roads connecting two cities so that any city can be reached from any other city using these roads. The cost of building a road connecting the i-th city and the j-th city is |i-j| Ã— D + A_i + A_j. Find the minimum possible total cost to achieve this objective.
