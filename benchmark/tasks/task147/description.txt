You want to obtain a treasure located in a dungeon underground at level N. Initially, you are on the first underground level with a certain amount of health H (H is a positive integer). Descending to lower levels drains your health, and the amount of health consumed to descend is known for each level. Each level also has a healing spring that can restore a fixed amount of health each time it is used. Your health cannot go below 0, and it can never exceed H. You can use the healing spring as many times as needed, but you aim to minimize the number of times you use it due to the time it takes to heal. Your task is to write a program that, given N, H, the health cost for descending from each level, and the health restored by the spring at each level, determines the minimum number of times the spring must be used to reach underground level N without letting your health drop to 0 or below. Note that once you descend to a lower level, you cannot return to a higher level until you obtain the treasure.
