You need to write a program that counts the total number of unique board arrangements for a concentration game played on a 4x4 board with 8 pairs of cards labeled from 'A' to 'H'. The arrangements must adhere to specific relative positions between the pairs of cards. Given multiple sets of four relative positions, your output should be the count of unique arrangements for each set. The end of input is indicated by a line with a single number greater than 4.
