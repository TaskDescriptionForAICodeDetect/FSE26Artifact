A long-standing peace was suddenly disrupted by the resurrection of the demon lord. A hero has emerged, embarking on a journey to collect legendary crystals scattered around the world. According to a legend, collecting all the crystals can summon a dragon god who can grant any wish, which includes the power to defeat the demon lord. The hero can move at a rate of 1 Euclidean distance per day. However, a significant problem arises as the demon lord emits dark miasma that spreads like a deadly land, restricting the hero's movement over time. The miasma expands at a rate of 1 Euclidean distance per day, preventing the hero from collecting crystals on the boundary of the miasma zone. The hero must quickly ascertain whether all crystals can be collected, given the starting position of the hero, the location of the resurrected demon lord, and the positions of the crystals. Importantly, the hero does not tire and does not sleep until all crystals are collected and the world is saved. You are tasked with writing a program that determines whether the hero can collect all crystals.
