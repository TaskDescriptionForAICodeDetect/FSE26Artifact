In the internet, data is divided into packets and transferred to the destination via devices called routers. Each router determines the next router to forward each packet based on the destination specified in the packet. To prevent packets from being endlessly forwarded between routers, packets have a TTL (Time To Live) value attached. Routers decrease the TTL of received packets by 1, and if the result is 0, the packet is discarded; otherwise, it is forwarded to the next router. Your task is to create a program that, given the network connection information and packets to be sent, displays the minimum number of routers each packet must pass through to reach the destination router. The network consists of multiple routers and directed cables connecting them. You will be provided with an array of router numbers that are directly connected to each router. If there are multiple paths from the source to the destination, output the smaller number of routers passed through. If the packet does not reach the destination, output 'NA'.
