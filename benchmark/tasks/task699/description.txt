There is a building with n rooms, numbered from 1 to n. Initially, one person is in each room. After a certain number of moves (k moves), we want to find out how many combinations of people can be in the n rooms now. Each move consists of a person moving from one room to another. Calculate the number of possible combinations of people in the rooms, output the count modulo (10^9 + 7).
