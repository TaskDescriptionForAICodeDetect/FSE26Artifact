There are N bags, each containing two white balls. The i-th bag contains two balls with integers x_i and y_i written on them, respectively. You will paint one of the balls red and the other blue for each bag. After classifying all 2N balls by color, define the following: R_{max} as the maximum integer on a red ball, R_{min} as the minimum integer on a red ball, B_{max} as the maximum integer on a blue ball, and B_{min} as the minimum integer on a blue ball. Your task is to find the minimum possible value of (R_{max} - R_{min}) * (B_{max} - B_{min}).
