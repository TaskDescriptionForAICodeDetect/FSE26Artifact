An adult game master and N children are playing a game on an ice rink for K rounds. In each round, the game master announces the size of groups A_i that the children must form. The goal is to determine the smallest and largest possible number of children N at the start, given the group sizes, while ensuring exactly two children remain after K rounds. If no valid number of N exists, return -1.
