You are given an integer sequence x of length N. Determine if there exists an integer sequence a that satisfies all of the following conditions, and if it exists, construct an instance of a. a is N^2 in length, containing N copies of each of the integers 1, 2, ..., N. For each 1 ≤ i ≤ N, the i-th occurrence of the integer i from the left in a is the x_i-th element of a from the left.
