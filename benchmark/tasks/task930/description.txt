We have a grid with n rows and 7 columns, referred to as a calendar. Each cell at (i, j) contains the integer 7i + j - 8 and is initially white. Snuke paints cells black based on the condition that the integer in the cell has a remainder a_i when divided by m for q operations. The task is to count the number of connected white regions in the grid, where connected regions consist of adjacent white cells.
