There is a tree with N vertices numbered 1 through N. The edges connect the vertices as given. Initially, each vertex is uncolored. Takahashi and Aoki are playing a game by painting the vertices alternately, starting with Takahashi. He paints a selected vertex white, and Aoki paints it black when it's his turn. After all vertices are colored, any white vertex adjacent to a black vertex is repainted black simultaneously. If any white vertices remain, Takahashi wins; if all are black, Aoki wins. The task is to determine the winner of the game given that both players play optimally.
