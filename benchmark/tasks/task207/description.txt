Write a program to determine if given nets of a die are proper or improper. A proper net of a die must be a valid net of a cube where numbers on opposite faces sum to 7, numbers on faces are unique, and the shape must not overlap or be disconnected. The input consists of multiple 5x5 mesh representations of these nets, and the output should be true or false for each net, indicating whether it is proper or not.
