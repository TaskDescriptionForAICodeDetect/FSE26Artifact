In the Country of Distortion, a directed graph defined with n vertices and m edges is provided. Every edge takes a certain time to traverse, and the initial perceived movement speed is given. The perceived movement speed changes each time an edge is traversed, according to a specified set of parameters. You need to compute the minimum total perceived distance when traveling from vertex 1 to vertex n and back to vertex 1.
