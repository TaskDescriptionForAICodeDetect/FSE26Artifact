Write a program that calculates the minimum cost to lead a robot from the start square at the northwest corner of a rectangular board to the goal square in the southeast corner. The robot can execute commands assigned to each square or explicit commands given by the player, each with associated costs. The robot loses if it goes out of the board or executes a 'Halt' command before reaching the goal.
