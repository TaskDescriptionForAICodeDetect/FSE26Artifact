You are given a directed graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1, 2, ..., N, and the edges are numbered 1, 2, ..., M. Edge i points from Vertex a_i to Vertex b_i. For each edge, determine whether the reversion of that edge would change the number of the strongly connected components in the graph. Here, the reversion of Edge i means deleting Edge i and then adding a new edge that points from Vertex b_i to Vertex a_i. Print 'diff' if the reversion changes the number of strongly connected components, and 'same' if it does not.
