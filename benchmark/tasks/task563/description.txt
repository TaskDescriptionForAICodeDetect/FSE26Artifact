There is a grid with H rows and W columns. Each cell in the grid contains a number between 1 and 6 or a '#' character. Cells where both the row index i and column index j are even have a '#' character. You have a die that you can initially place in the cell (1, 1), where the bottom face shows 6, the front face shows 2, and the right face shows 3. You can roll the die to any of the four adjacent cells any number of times, but must follow these rules: you cannot roll outside the grid, you cannot roll into a cell with a '#' character, and the number on the bottom face of the die must match the number in the target cell after rolling. Determine if you can move the die from cell (1, 1) to cell (H, W).
