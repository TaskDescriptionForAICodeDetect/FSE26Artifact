You are given N-1 subsets of {1,2,...,N}. Let the i-th set be E_i. Choose two distinct elements u_i and v_i from each set E_i to form a graph T with N vertices and N-1 edges, where the vertex set is {1,2,..,N} and the edge set is (u_1,v_1),(u_2,v_2),...,(u_{N-1},v_{N-1}). Determine if T can be a tree by properly selecting u_i and v_i. If it can, additionally find one configuration of (u_1,v_1),(u_2,v_2),...,(u_{N-1},v_{N-1}) such that T is a tree.
