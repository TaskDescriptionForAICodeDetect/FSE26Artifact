Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are (x_i, y_i), and its hardness is c_i. Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates (X, Y), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i * sqrt((X - x_i)^2 + (Y - y_i)^2) seconds. Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he puts the heat source to minimize this time.
