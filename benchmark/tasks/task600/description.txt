For given two circles c1 and c2, print the coordinates of the intersection points of them. The input is provided in the format 'c1x c1y c1r' for the first circle and 'c2x c2y c2r' for the second circle. The output should be the coordinates of the intersection points in decimal format with a precision error of less than 0.000001. If there is one intersection point, print the same coordinates twice. Print the coordinate with the smaller x first, and in case of a tie, print the smaller y first.
