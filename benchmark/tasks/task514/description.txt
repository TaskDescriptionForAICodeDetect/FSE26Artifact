You and AOR Squid are preparing for competitive programming's graph problems. AOR Squid is responsible for generating input cases. The input case of the problem is a directed graph with N vertices numbered from 1 to N. It may include self-loops, but it does not include multiple edges. Suddenly, AOR Squid becomes unreachable, and the original graph can no longer be obtained. The only remaining information is: the number of vertices with an in-degree of i is a_i, meaning there are a_i vertices that have i as their endpoint; the number of vertices with an out-degree of i is b_i, meaning there are b_i vertices that have i as their starting point. Determine if there exists a directed graph that is consistent with the remaining information. If it exists, output 'YES' followed by one such graph that is consistent. If there are multiple possibilities, any one can be output. If it does not exist, output 'NO'.
