The problem involves calculating the time required for a group of swimmers to complete their planned laps in a swimming pool with two lanes. Each swimmer has a constant pace which dictates how long it takes them to swim from one end of the pool to the other. Swimmers can only pass each other at the ends of the lanes and must follow slower swimmers if they are ahead. The swimmers congregate at the end of the lane and may change order based on their natural paces. You need to calculate the total time for all swimmers to complete their laps starting at the same time.
