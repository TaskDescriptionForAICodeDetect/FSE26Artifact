There are N robots and M exits on a number line. Each robot will disappear from the number line when its position coincides with that of an exit. Calculate the number of combinations of exits that can be used by the robots when all the robots disappear, modulo 10^9 + 7. Two combinations are considered different if there is a robot that uses different exits in those two combinations.
