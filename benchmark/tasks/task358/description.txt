The sales department of Japanese Ancient Giant Corp. is staying in a large room of a Japanese-style hotel called a ryokan. They use Japanese-style beds called futons which occupy two adjacent cells in a grid representation of the room. The goal is to determine if anyone can avoid sleeping with their feet adjacent to another person's head, which is considered a bad custom. You need to write a program that checks this condition based on the given input data.
