There is a grid with N rows and N columns of squares. Each of the central (N-2) x (N-2) squares has a black stone on it, and each of the squares on the bottom and right sides has a white stone on it. You will be given Q queries, each of which will either place a white stone in the first column or the first row, replacing black stones with white stones along the way. The goal is to determine how many black stones remain after processing all the queries.
