Write a program to verify Pollock's conjecture for individual integers. The program should calculate the least number of tetrahedral numbers required to represent each input integer as their sum, and also perform a similar calculation using only odd tetrahedral numbers. Each tetrahedral number may be used multiple times. The input consists of a sequence of positive integers, each less than 10^6, terminating with a zero. For each integer, the output should be two integers: the least number of tetrahedral numbers and the least number of odd tetrahedral numbers required to represent that integer.
