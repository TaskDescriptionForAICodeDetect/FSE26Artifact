You are playing a solitaire puzzle called 'Connect', which uses several letter tiles. There are R x C empty cells. For each i (1 ≤ i ≤ R), you must place a string si (1 ≤ |si| ≤ C) in the i-th row of the table, without changing the letter order. For each non-empty cell x, you get a point equal to the number of adjacent cells that have the same character as x. Two cells are adjacent if they share an edge. Calculate the maximum total point you can get.
