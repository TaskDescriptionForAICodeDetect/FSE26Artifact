We have two desks: A and B. Desk A has a vertical stack of N books on it, and Desk B has M books. Each book on Desk A takes A_i minutes to read and each book on Desk B takes B_i minutes. The task is to determine the maximum number of books that can be read from both desks without exceeding a total reading time of K minutes. The reading process consists of choosing a desk with a book remaining, reading the topmost book on that desk, and then removing it from the desk.
