You are given an integer sequence of length N. In one operation, you can select a term and either increment or decrement it by one. Determine the minimum number of operations required to ensure that for every i (1≤i≤n), the sum of the terms from the 1st through the ith term is not zero, and for every i (1≤i≤n-1), the sign of the sum from the 1st through the ith term is different from the sign of the sum from the 1st through (i+1)th term.
