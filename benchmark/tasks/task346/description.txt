You are in a fantasy world where you fight against monsters using magic spells. Each monster has hit points, and you can decrease these hit points with spells that either target a single monster or all monsters. You have a limited amount of magic power, and your goal is to defeat all the monsters using the least magic power possible. Write a program to determine the minimum amount of magic power consumed to defeat all monsters given multiple datasets.
