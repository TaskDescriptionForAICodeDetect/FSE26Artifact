We have a board with a 2 x N grid. Snuke covered the board with N dominoes without overlaps. A domino can cover a 1 x 2 or 2 x 1 square. Snuke decided to paint these dominoes using three colors: red, cyan, and green. Adjacent dominoes must be painted with different colors, but it is not always necessary to use all three colors. The goal is to find the number of ways to paint the dominoes, modulo 1000000007. The arrangement of the dominoes is given as two strings S_1 and S_2, where each domino is represented by a different English letter (lowercase or uppercase). The j-th character in S_i represents the domino that occupies the square at the i-th row from the top and j-th column from the left.
