Sigma and his brother Sugim are in a H x W grid and want to buy souvenirs. They start at the upper-left cell and aim to reach the lower-right cell. Some cells contain souvenir shops with a certain number of souvenirs, defined by a matrix where each cell (i, j) contains a_{i, j} souvenirs. They can move left, right, up, or down, but can only make H + W - 2 moves to reach their goal. Your task is to write a program that calculates the maximum number of souvenirs they can collect.
