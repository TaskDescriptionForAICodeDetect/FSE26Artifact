The International Christmas Present Company (ICPC) needs to optimize the delivery schedule for presents to children on Christmas Eve. Your task is to write a program that calculates the minimum number of Santas required to fulfill delivery requests on time. The input contains multiple datasets with information about the number of houses, roads, and delivery requests. Each dataset specifies the road network and the requests that must be delivered to specific houses by certain times.
