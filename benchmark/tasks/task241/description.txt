You need to develop a program that simulates the functionality of a shredder for a Shredding Company. The shredder takes a target number and a number written on a sheet of paper, and it must shred the paper into pieces such that the sum of the pieces is as close as possible to the target number without exceeding it. If the target number is equal to the number on the paper, it should not be shredded. If no valid combinations can be formed, the output should be 'error'. If multiple combinations yield the same sum closest to the target without exceeding it, the output should be 'rejected'. The input consists of multiple test cases ending with '0 0'. Each test case provides the target number and the number on the paper. The output for each test case will either show the sum and the parts, or an error/rejected message depending on the conditions described.
