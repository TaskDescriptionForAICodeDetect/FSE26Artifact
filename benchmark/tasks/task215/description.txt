In the year 2300, a project is initiated to compile the genome sequences of all living creatures in the universe into a database. The genome sequences consist of English capital letters and can be compressed when there are multiple repetitions of sequences. Your task is to write a program that uncompresses these compressed genome sequences and retrieves the i-th letter from the resulting sequence.
