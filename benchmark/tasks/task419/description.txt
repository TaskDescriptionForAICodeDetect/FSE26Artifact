In a city where rabbits live, there are V intersections and E roads. Each road connects two intersections bidirectionally. The rabbit enjoys walking and prefers to return to the starting intersection by traversing an odd number of roads. The mayor of the city wants to add as many roads as possible between different intersections but is mischievous and wants to ensure that there is no route that includes returning to the starting intersection by traversing an odd number of roads. The task is to determine the maximum number of roads that can be added. If the rabbit's request is already satisfied, output -1.
