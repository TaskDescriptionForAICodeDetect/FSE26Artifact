You are trying to retrieve an item that has rolled under a desk, but your arm is stuck. While trying to reach for it using your phone's screen as a flashlight, your arm accidentally gets caught. You contemplate calling for help but hesitate due to embarrassment. However, you remember you can send an email using your phone, even if you can't see the screen well. You type a message based on a specific input method related to phone keypads, where pressing '1' once inputs 'あ', '11' inputs 'い', and so on. Unfortunately, there's an issue with this method where pressing the key with a delay can change the resulting characters. You need to determine how many distinct messages could have been sent given the constraints of this input method. Input will be multiple cases of strings made up of digits 0-9, ending with a line containing a single '#'. Each string can be up to 100,000 characters long, but no more than 50 cases can exceed 10,000 characters. The output for each input string should be the number of interpretations of the message modulo 100000007.
