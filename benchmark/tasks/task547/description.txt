You are given a list of N intervals, where each interval is represented as [l_i, r_i) denoting a range of numbers. Your task is to compute two integers: the minimum integer x such that you can select x intervals from the given N intervals to cover the range [0, L), and the minimum integer y such that all possible combinations of y intervals from the given N intervals cover [0, L). You need to write a program to compute these two numbers.
