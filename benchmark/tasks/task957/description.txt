Takahashi and Aoki are constructing a sequence of integers. First, Takahashi provides a sequence of integers a, satisfying the following conditions: the length of a is N, each element in a is an integer between 1 and K (inclusive), and a is a palindrome. Aoki will move the first element in a to the end of a an arbitrary number of times. Calculate how many sequences a can be obtained after this procedure, modulo 10^9+7.
