There is a grid with H rows and W columns, where each square is painted black or white. You are given H strings S_1, S_2, ..., S_H, each of length W. If the square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left is painted black, the j-th character in the string S_i is '#'; if that square is painted white, the j-th character in the string S_i is '.'. Find the number of pairs of a black square c_1 and a white square c_2 such that there is a path from c_1 to c_2, moving to a vertically or horizontally adjacent square through an alternating sequence of black and white squares: black, white, black, white...
