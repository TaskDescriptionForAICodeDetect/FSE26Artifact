Rodea-kun is in a one-dimensional coordinate system, standing at position x = 0. From this position, he throws arrows of positive integer lengths aimed at the target located at x = N, moving at a constant speed of 1. However, due to his limited strength, he places a total of M propellers in the interval 0 ≤ x ≤ N. A scenario is defined as a 'loss' if the position from the tip to the base of the arrow does not include any propeller. The loss is judged when the tip of the arrow reaches positions x = 1, 2, 3, ..., N (a total of N times). You must process Q queries where each query gives a permissible number of losses l_i, which means that it is possible to deliver the arrow to the target if the total losses during N evaluations are less than or equal to l_i. The task is to determine the minimum length of the arrow required to deliver it to the target.
