In a Bingo game, there are several players with Bingo cards containing M x M numbers. Players punch holes in their cards when the gamemaster announces numbers. At least one player wins by completing a line of punched numbers (Bingo) either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. However, in this problem, the gamemaster controls the game's number announcement sequence to ensure that player i makes Bingo before player j if i < j. Your task is to write a program that determines the minimum length of a sequence of numbers that satisfies this condition.
