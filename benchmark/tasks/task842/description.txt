Takahashi has a tower divided into N layers, initially uncolored. He will paint some layers red, green, or blue to create a beautiful tower. The beauty of the tower is defined as the sum of scores of the N layers. A red layer scores A, a green layer scores A + B, a blue layer scores B, and an uncolored layer scores 0. Takahashi aims to achieve a beauty score of exactly K. You need to determine how many ways there are to paint the tower, considering different colors for different layers. The result should be given modulo 998244353.
