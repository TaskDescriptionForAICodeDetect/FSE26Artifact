Mary Thomas has a number of sheets of squared paper, some squares of which are painted either black or colorful (such as red and blue) on the front side. By cutting off the unpainted parts, she will have eight opened-up unit cubes. A unit cube refers to a cube that has each face consisting of one square. She aims to build these eight unit cubes with the front side exposed and then create a bicube with them. A bicube is a 2 × 2 × 2 cube consisting of eight unit cubes, and it must satisfy the following conditions: the faces of the unit cubes that face the inside of the bicube must all be black; each face of the bicube must have a uniform colorful color; and the faces of the bicube must all have different colors. Your task is to write a program that reads the specification of a sheet of squared paper and decides if a bicube can be built with the resulting eight unit cubes.
