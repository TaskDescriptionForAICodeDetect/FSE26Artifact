We have N irregular jigsaw pieces. Each piece is composed of three rectangular parts of width 1 and various heights joined together. More specifically: The i-th piece is a part of height H, with another part of height A_i joined to the left, and yet another part of height B_i joined to the right. Snuke is arranging these pieces on a square table of side 10^{100}. The following conditions must be held: All pieces must be put on the table. The entire bottom side of the center part of each piece must touch the front side of the table. The entire bottom side of the non-center parts of each piece must either touch the front side of the table, or touch the top side of a part of some other piece. The pieces must not be rotated or flipped. Determine whether such an arrangement is possible.
