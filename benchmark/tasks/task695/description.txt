We have a bingo card with a 3x3 grid. The square at the i-th row from the top and the j-th column from the left contains the number A[i][j]. The MC will choose N numbers, b1, b2, ..., bN. If our bingo sheet contains some of those numbers, we will mark them on our sheet. Determine whether we will have a bingo when the N numbers are chosen, meaning the sheet will contain three marked numbers in a row, column, or diagonal.
