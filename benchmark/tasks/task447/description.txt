The colors of the Rubik's Cube sold in Japan have recently been aligned with the standard adopted worldwide. To get accustomed to this, let's first scramble a simple 2x2x2 cube and play. The initial state of the Rubik's Cube has each color gathered on one face, with red on the top, yellow on the front, and blue on the right side. The bottom is orange, the back is white, and the left side is green. The rotations of each face in a clockwise direction by 90Â° are represented by their initials: U, F, R, D, B, L. The scrambling of the Rubik's Cube is then represented as a string S related to each rotation operation. You need to output the colors of each face of the Rubik's Cube in a development diagram after applying the given input operations from the initial state.
