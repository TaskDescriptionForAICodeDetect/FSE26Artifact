The shadow witch ELSAMARIA continuously prays for everything. Any life caught in the shadows is dragged into this witch. The shadows move like tentacles and are trying to pull Sayaka Miki in. To attack without getting caught by the witch, Sayaka plans to make random movements that are difficult for the witch to predict. Specifically, she will generate K integers uniformly at random from 1 to N, and jump towards the witch's direction by the distance equal to the sum of those integers. She will attack when she reaches the witch's position. Sayaka and the witch are on a straight line, with the witch at coordinate 0 and Sayaka at coordinate S. The witch does not move. Determine how many jumps it will take for Sayaka to first attack the witch and find the expected value of those jumps. If it is impossible to reach the witchâ€™s position with any number of jumps, or if the expected value is not bounded, output -1. The output can have any number of decimal places as long as the relative or absolute error is less than 10^-6.
