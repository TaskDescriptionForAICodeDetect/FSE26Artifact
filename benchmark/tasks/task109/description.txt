Given an initial arrangement of blocks, create a program that outputs the minimum number of operations required to rearrange the blocks into a triangular shape, as described. The triangular numbers correspond to numbers represented by the formula k*(k+1)/2 (e.g., 1, 3, 6, 10, ...). If creating the triangular shape is not possible or if the number of operations exceeds 10,000, output -1.
