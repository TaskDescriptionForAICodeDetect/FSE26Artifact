Twins Ami and Mami have a lot of homework to do during their summer vacation, and you, as their guardian, have decided to keep them inside until they finish their book reports. Each child must read all the books independently and write reports without collaborating. The goal is to find a schedule that allows them to finish their homework as quickly as possible considering they cannot read the same book at the same time, and they must complete reading and writing without interruption. You are provided with several datasets where you need to calculate the minimum time it takes to finish all the reports based on the reading and writing durations for each book.
