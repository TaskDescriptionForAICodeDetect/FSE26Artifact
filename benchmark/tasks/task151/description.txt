The problem describes a scenario where a marine researcher wants to study the habitats of N types of fish in the Indian Ocean. Each type of fish has a rectangular prism-shaped habitat defined by two corner points in a 3D space. The researcher wants to calculate the total volume of regions where at least K types of fish habitats overlap. The input consists of the numbers N and K followed by N lines that specify the habitats of each fish type. The output should be the total volume of the overlapping regions.
