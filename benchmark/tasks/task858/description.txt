You have a grid with H rows and W columns, where integers from 1 to HÃ—W are distributed across the squares. You are a magical girl who can teleport a piece from one square to another by using a certain amount of magic points, calculated as the Manhattan distance between the two squares. You must take Q tests where, for each test, you start on a square containing the integer L_i and repeatedly move to the square containing the integer x+D until reaching R_i. The goal is to find the total magic points consumed during each test.
